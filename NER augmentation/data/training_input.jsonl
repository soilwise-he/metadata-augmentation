{"text":"Our study reveals the effects of GCFs on a soil-crop system: in general, with an increasing number of GCFs, soil properties, and plant biomass reacted negatively. For example, the higher the level of GCFs, the lower the plant biomass and soil water stable aggregation. We also find that MP applied as a single factor had minimal effects on soil properties and crop growth. However, when combined with other individual factors, it significantly altered the effect size, sometimes even causing directional change. Our results revealed that the interaction between MP and other GCFs is not an additive response. Due to the characteristics of MP, the interaction mechanism between heavy metal and MP is obviously different from the response between drought and MP, and their combined effects on the soil-plant system may fundamentally vary Factor interactions are key to understanding and predicting how GCFs influence soil and plants. With an increasing number of GCFs involved, it becomes more and more complicated to predict effects on ecosystems. Our study is among the first to systematically examine how microplastic acts in combination with a range of other important environmental drivers, and thus offers a first step toward understanding these elusive interactive effects.","id":"0007bad6-848d-4763-9813-d5ed21cde6ee"}

{"text":"The dataset contains the yearly number of climatic compound events in the 96 counties of Bavaria between 1981 and 2021 in the development phases of maize and winter wheat. Compound events are defined as multiple extreme events occurring together, in this case, heat (high temperatures) and drought (low precipitation). Climatic values are considered extreme if they are higher (or lower in the case of precipitation) than certain thresholds. The thresholds were defined via the percentiles of values in the climatically more stable reference period between 1951 and 1980. The temperature and precipitation values were obtained from the weather stations run by the German Meteorological Service (DWD). For the study period 1981 \u2013 2021, they were brought on the spatial scale of the Bavarian counties via Thiessen-Polygons. For the reference period, the values were not differentiated spatially but applied for whole Bavaria which leads to a higher number of extreme events in dryer regions. Temporally, the extreme events were differentiated for the development phases of maize and winter wheat. The percentiles were applied to the climatic values from the whole development phases (May \u2013 October for maize, November \u2013 July for winter wheat, always for the whole months), the vegetative phase (May \u2013 July for maize, November \u2013 April for winter wheat), and the reproductive phase (August \u2013 October for maize, May \u2013 July for winter wheat). To account for the water storage in the soil, in addition to the precipitation of one day, extremes of the precipitation sums of this day with the 9, 19, and 29 preceding days were calculated as well. Multiple extreme events were defined as compound events when they fall together in the same county and on the same day. These compound events were calculated in five severity levels depending on the applied percentiles (above the 95th percentile for temperature values and below the 10th percentile for precipitation as the most severe level, followed by the 90th and 20th, 85th and 30th, 80th and 40th, as well as the 75th and 50th percentile). From the daily compound events, finally, the yearly sums were built for each county. The first column of the dataset describes from how many days the precipitation sum was built, in which development phases the compound events lie, and with which severity level. For each of these 120 combinations, the values for the years 1981 \u2013 2021 in the 96 counties are given.

{"text":"Apple replant disease (ARD) is a threat to apple fruit and tree production worldwide caused by shifts in the soil microbiome. Chemical and physical measures of soil disinfection are the most employed countermeasures but inter-row plantings demonstrate that ARD is widely immobile in the soil, which causes the plant to face ARD affected and healthy soil simultaneously in the field. We simulated this situation in a split-root approach in two experiments using rhizoboxes, soil from the ORDIAmur ARD references sites Heidgraben and Ellerhoop and the apple rootstock M26. Root growth was monitored via the transparent front panel of the rhizoboxes and shoot growth was measured weekly. After two weeks, root systems from a subset of plants were sampled for expression analysis of ARD candidate genes. After eight weeks, masses of roots and shoots were recorded and contents of selected phenolic compounds were analyzed.\nRoot and shoot growth were severely reduced whenever both compartments of the rhizobox were filled with ARD soil in comparison to both compartments filled with disinfected ARD soil. Plants with only half of the root system growing in ARD soil showed a local reduction in root growth with an intermediate shoot growth. In ARD affected roots, the expression of the three ARD biomarker genes, biphenyl synthase 3, biphenyl 4-hydroxylase and ethylene-responsive transcription factor 1B-like, was locally induced after two weeks in comparison to disinfected ARD or control soil. Phenolic compound profiles in the roots showed a high variation between samples and soils. The total phenolic content as well as the contents of epicatechin and an unknown phenolic compound were locally increased in roots grown in ARD soil in comparison to disinfected ARD soil after eight weeks. Our results show how apple plants focus their molecular defense towards ARD locally in the roots. The local nature of ARD presents both challenges in the assessment of ARD severity in the field as for possible management strategies involving soil tillage.\n\nResearch domain: Plant Breeding\n\nResearch question: The objectives of this study were (i) to link the previously observed localized growth response to a local response of the selected genes and phenolic metabolites and (ii) identify the phenolic compounds that can be useful in unraveling ARD.","id":"03a597e4-004f-45e1-b18a-78ca607b51e4"}

This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents.

The V140 is around 0.5 ha and is located on a flat area. Before the establishment of V140 the site was cultivated uniformly. According to the German Guidelines Soil Assessment (Bodensch\u00e4tzung) the dominating soil types are slightly loamy sand and sand (Sl4D and S4D). The most common soil sub type is Haplic Luvisol.

The search was restricted to articles in English published between January 2014 and January 2019. We identified 227 articles, out of which 179 met our selection criteria. Using a full-text review, we extracted information on ecosystem services addressed and indicators used. We also recorded the type of input data used and the spatial scale the indicators were used at or recommended for. Where studies used ecosystem service definitions other than the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES V.5.1), indicators were assigned to the corresponding CICES class or classes. We used the information derived from the review to create factsheets for 37 ecosystem services relevant to agricultural land and soil management. Each factsheet provides tables with available indicators applicable at spatial scales ranging from field to global, information on the type of input data required and a link to the complete bibliographic information of the article or articles the indicator was taken from. Since the dataset is based on a systematic sample of publications on ecosystem service supply, it indicates the current research focus and research gaps.

{"text":"Drainage and agricultural use transform natural peatlands from a net carbon (C) sink to a net C source. Rewetting of peatlands, despite of high methane (CH4) emissions, holds the potential to mitigate climate change by greatly reducing CO2 emissions. However, the time span for this transition is unknown because most studies are limited to a few years. Especially, non-permanent open water areas often created after rewetting, are highly productive. Here, we present 14 consecutive years of CH4 flux measurements following rewetting of a formerly long-term drained peatland in the Peene valley. Measurements were made at two rewetted sites (non-inundated vs. inundated) using manual chambers. During the study period, significant differences in measured CH4 emissions occurred. In general, these differences overlapped with stages of ecosystem transition from a cultivated grassland to a polytrophic lake dominated by emergent helophytes, but could also be additionally explained by other variables. This transition started with a rapid vegetation shift from dying cultivated grasses to open water floating and submerged hydrophytes and significantly increased CH4 emissions. Since 2008, helophytes have gradually spread from the shoreline into the open water area, especially in drier years. This process was periodically delayed by exceptional inundation and eventually resulted in the inundated site being covered by emergent helophytes. While the period between 2009 and 2015 showed exceptionally high CH4 emissions, these decreased significantly after cattail and other emergent helophytes became dominant at the inundated site. Therefore, CH4 emissions declined only after ten years of transition following rewetting, potentilly reaching a new steady state. Overall, this study highlights the importance of an integrative approach to understand the shallow lakes CH4 biogeochemistry, encompassing the entire area with its mosaic of different vegetation forms. This should be ideally done through a study design including proper measurement site allocation as well as long-term measurements.

{"text":"Current efforts to enhance the agroecosystems carbon (C) sink function for climate mitigation faced challenges, particularly with traditional measures having limited suitability for increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks.  One way out of this dilemma could be to create an additional stable soil C sink by inducing SOC under saturation in the topsoil. In the past, attempts were made by abrupt topsoil dilution through subsoil admixture by means of deep tillage but with varying degrees of success. This was partly due to a lack of knowledge about the impact of soil condition like erosion state and N fertilization form ensuring optimum C input into the soil on the desired additional SOC accumulation and partly due to the lack of suitable experimental approaches to record the effect of all relevant factors simultaneously. To help solve these problems, a three-factorial experimental field trial were established: I.) \"moderate topsoil dilution\" (diluted vs non-diluted), II.) \"N fertilization form\" (mineral, i.e., calcium ammonium nitrate and urea vs organic, i.e., digestate) and III.)  \"soil types\" (Calcic Luvisol, Nudiargic Luvisol, and Calcaric Regosol) covering the typical range of erosion states in the hummocky ground moraine landscape of NE Germany. \nThis datasets contains weather data, NDVI/RVI measurements data , soil texture data, soil and plant analysis data, CO2 flux obtained using a novel robotic chamber system that were conducted from 23.07.2020 (after manipulation) - 29.06.2021 (Harvest).\n\nThis table contains the index of all tables forming this data collection.\n\nRelated datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.\nDataset version 1.0","id":"12f3a7bb-02da-4c99-b5bd-9803a0960263"}

{"text":"P adsorption was investigated on synthetic and commercially available goethite (99 %, Alfa Aesar). The composition and crystallinity was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analyses with an Empyrean powder diffractometer (PANalytical) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.15418 nm). The determination of the d-values and the verification of the calculated lattice parameter were performed using the XPowder software. The specific surface area of 17.2 m2 g-1 was determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome) using a five-point BET measurement and N2. The point of zero charge (PZC) was determined using potentiometric titration by weighing 0.5 g of goethite into 50 ml PE-tubes and adding of 10 ml of a 0.02 M, 0.2 M, and 2 M KCl solution, respectively. The KCl solutions were diluted with ultrapure water to a total volume of 20 ml, leading to final concentrations of 0.01 M, 0.1 M, and 1 M, respectively. After closing the tubes, the samples were equilibrated for 4 days at 25\u00b0C to reach an equilibration pH value. Following, the suspension was titrated with 0.1 M KOH, and the pH was recorded after each addition of KOH as a function of the volume. A similar procedure was used for the blank solutions. The adsorbed amounts of H+ or OH- were calculated from the amount of KOH added to the samples minus the amount of KOH used by blank titration. The titration curves of the three different concentration steps intersect at the PZC, which was 8.8 for pure goethite without adsorbed P.\nP adsorption on goethite was studied in a batch setup at the pH values of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Therefore, goethite sample material (5 g) for the respective pH steps was adjusted to pH 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12, respectively, in ultrapure water with 0.01 M HCl (pH 4), or 0.1 M to 5 M KOH (pH 6 to 12) using a Potentiometric Compact Titrator G20S and combined DGi115-SC pH electrode (Mettler-Toledeo) under continuous stirring. For P adsorption, 0.5 g of goethite and 40 ml of a 0.15 mmol l-1 KH2PO4, solution, adjusted to pH 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 as well, were mixed to achieve a solid-solution ratio of 1:80. The goethite- KH2PO4 mixture was shaken horizontally at 150 motions min-1 for 24 h. The P concentration in the solution was determined after reaction times of 2, 24, 48, and 168 h. The samples have been centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 rpm and the clear supernatant was filtrated by using P-poor Whatmann 512 \u00bd filters. The concentrations of P and Fe were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The adsorption experiments were done in duplicate.\nUnder real conditions in the soil, an influence of the P sorption on the pH is to be expected. Therefore, the pH change was taken into account both at the beginning and at the end of the adsorption experiments. The pH change was measured in a reference experiment that was treated exactly under the same conditions as P adsorption experiment. The amount of adsorbed P was referred to both the initial and the final pH.\nConsidering the initial pH, P adsorption on goethite was highest for pH 8, yielding a P surface coverage of 0.75 \u00b5mol m-2 after a reaction time of 168 h, followed by pH 6 with 0.72 \u00b5mol m-2, and pH 4 with 0.68 \u00b5mol m-2. The extent of adsorption decreased from pH 8 to 10 with 0.58 \u00b5mol m-2 and was lowest for pH 12 with 0.18 \u00b5mol m-2. The solution pH decreased for the initial pH 4 to 3.9., and for the initial pH of 6, the final pH was 5.0. For initial pH values 8.0 and 10.0, the corresponding final pH values were 6.7 and 7.6, respectively. At initial pH 12.0, the decrease of the solution pH weakened with a final pH of 11.6.\n\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences\n\nResearch question: How does the solution-pH affect the amount of adsorbed phosphorus on the goethite surface?","id":"142faafb-4e71-4b1e-b550-ca6864f5234b"}

{"text":"The base neutralizing capacity was determined according to Meiwes (1984) (see also Utermann et al., 2000). The method essentially consists of the addition of varying concentrations of a base to aliquots of the soil sample. The resulting pH changes are recorded along with the base concentration added.\n\nDespite of being a natural soil forming process, soil acidification is a major agronomic challenge under humid climate conditions as soil acidity influences several yield relevant soil properties. It can be counterbalanced by the regular application of agricultural lime to maintain or re-establish soil fertility and to optimize plant growth and yield. A direct method to determine the lime requirement (LR) of an agricultural soil is the base neutralizing capacity (BNC). It is a soil-base titrations that is defined as the amount of soil acidity that is neutralized by a base in a given time interval to a certain pH value. One advantage of the BNC-based LR is that it studies the effect of base addition on the pH individually for each soil sample. This is in contrast to the conventional indirect LR method applied in Germany that estimates the soil\u2019s LR based on empirical relationships derived in field experiments which does not further take into account (or measure) other factors affecting pH buffering such as clay mineralogy.\n\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences\n\nResearch question: Lime requirements of soils","id":"15c2b5c3-f224-49c0-94d8-4e1ed0d67eda"}

The area of research is the AgroScape Lab Quillow in the Uckermark in North-East Germany\nCoordinates of the stations can be found in the Supplemental material.\n\nMethods and obstacles\nFor the experiment six weather stations \u2018Davis vantage pro 2\u2019 were installed in the Quillow catchment area in the Uckermark. The six stations are located near the villages Dedelow, Rittgarten, Arendsee, Falkenhagen, Raakow and Kraatz (see supplemental data for exact coordinates).\nThe rain catcher was installed in a height of 1, 90 m, in order to avoid overgrowth and unwanted interferences by nearby plants. The anemometers were angled north. \nThe weather station in Dedelow was set up on the 03.05.2019. The five other stations were set up on the 28.06.2019. However, all calculations were conducted with the 01.07.2019 as starting point.\nThe data collected by the stations were gathered once every 7 weeks. In September 2020 however, there was a memory overflow issue, because of the corona pandemic the data were gathered two days after the station had reached its storage capacity of 53 days. Therefore, two days (12-13.08.2020) were missing for each station. \nFurthermore, the station 188 in Falkenhagen was having technical issues several times, leading to data gaps of several days and weeks.\nIn addition, the station in Dedelow does not collect the data consistently, probably due to transmissions issues, since the receiver is located inside a building which is approximately 30 m away from the station. The receivers of the other stations however are located inside a box which is attached directly to the station. \nAlso, the weather station 807 was hit by a tractor and hence was not in an upright position for an unknown period of time. This was discovered on the 19.12.2019. Therefore, the precipitation values of station 807 were replaced by the values of the closest station 275 in the period of 01.11.2019 \u2013 19.12.2019.

{"text":"Societal demands on soil functionality in agricultural soil-landscapes are confronted with yield losses and environmental impact. Soil functional information at national scale is required to address these challenges.

Each SFT is described by a multivariate soil parameter distribution along its depth profile. The agglomerated simplicity of the 3D multivariate soil parameter space into a limited number of spatially allocated process units provides the basis to run agricultural process models at national scale (Germany). \nThe data product refers to the parameter space until a depth of 1 m. It has a 100 m raster resolution in the 2D mapping space, and its resolution along the depth profile is 1 cm. It includes the soil properties: horizon occurrence probability of the organic horizon (symbol_H), the horizon with stagnic properties (symbol_S), groundwater influence (symbol G), and the C horizon (symbol_C), the depth limitation by bedrock (symbol_mC) as well as the soil properties texture (sand_content,  silt_content,  clay_content), stone content, and bulk density.\nThe data product consists of three files: A nationwide raster (SFT.tif) indicating the spatial allocation of the SFTs in terms of an identifier variable, and two related tables (MSPD1.csv and MSPD2.csv) including the information of the multivariate parameter distributions of the SFTs.

The soil samples were dried at 40 \u00b0C for five days and passed through a 2-mm sieve. Soil organic C and total N were determined using a CN analyzer (Elementar Vario El; Elementar Analysis Systems GmbH, Hanau, Germany); for soil samples with pH \u2265 6.0 pre-treatment for the removal of carbonates was performed (Harris et al. 2001). Soil pH was determined with a soil:water ratio of 1:4. The effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) was determined as the sum of the cations determined by percolation of the soil with unbuffered 1 mol L-1 NH4Cl followed by analysis of the exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Al, Fe, and Mn) in the percolate using an inductively coupled plasma-atomic spectrometer (ICP-AES; iCAP 6300 Duo VIEW ICP Spectrometer, Thermo Fischer Scientific GmbH, Dreieich, Germany).

{"text":"The European Commission Joint Research Centre performed a study that identifies factors affecting the fate of buried objects in soil and develops a method for assessing where preservation of different materials and stratigraphic evidence is more or less likely in the landscape. The results inform the extent of the cultural service that soil supports by preserving artefacts from and information about past societies. They are also relevant to predicting the state of existing and planned buried infrastructure and the persistence of materials spread on land. Soils are variable and preserve different materials and stratigraphic evidence differently. This study identifies the material and soil properties that affect preservation and relates these to soil types; it assesses their preservation capacities for bones, teeth and shells, organic materials, metals (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Pb and bronze), ceramics, glass and stratigraphic evidence. Preservation of Au, Pb and ceramics, glass and phytoliths is good in most soils but degradation rates of other materials (e.g. Fe and organic materials)\u00a0is strongly influenced by soil type. A method is proposed for using data on the distribution of soil types to map the variable preservation capacities of soil for different materials. This is applied at a continental scale across the EU for bones, teeth and shells, organic materials, metals (Cu, bronze and Fe) and stratigraphic evidence. The maps produced demonstrate how soil provides an extensive but variable preservation of buried objects.\n\u00a0\nThe results of the study have been published: \u00a0\"Predicting the preservation of cultural artefacts and buried materials in soil\", Mark Kibblewhite, Gergely T\u00f3th,Tam\u00e1s Hermann, Science of The Total Environment, Volume 529, 1 October 2015, Pages 249\u2013263.\n\u00a0\nThe 4 maps come as 1 shapefile with an attribute table that contains 4 fields corresponding to the 4 parameters mentioned above:\n\nbones, teeth and shells (bones)\norganic materials (organics)\nmetals (Cu, bronze and Fe) (metals)\nstratigraphic evidence (strati)\n\nThe values of the attrubutes vary between 1 and 3, as explained in the paper.\n\u00a0\nThe geometry of the shapefile is the one of the European Soil Database.

{"text":"Between 2017 and 2019 we studied the abundance of spider mites in the soil to estimate the potential infestation pressure of soil colonizing spider mites. The spider mites were heterogeneously distributed in small concentrations in the soil. Soil colonizing spider mites did not affect spider mite abundance on plants and reversed. We observed that spider mite migration occurred primarily from the edge of the field adjacent to the weed strip. In 2020 and 2021, we investigated the efficacy of the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) for suppressing spider mite hotspots in the cropland. We compared untreated spider mite hotspots with N. californicus treated hotspots and showed that a single release of predatory mites could result in a high level of control when spider mite infestation density was initially high. With this study, soil can be ruled out as a habitat for spider mites, and attention to spider mite pest control can be directed to plant infestations. The highly sensitive HRM real-time PCR assay was used for the quantification of the spider mites. Tetranychus urticae served as reference. Research domain: Soil Sciences Research question: Does the soil serve as a shelter for spider mites and must the soil be included in control strategies?

{"text":"The synthetic commercially hydroxides were goethite (99%, Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, Massachusetts, USA), and gibbsite (Merck Millipore, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), which were of analytical grade. 2-line-ferrihydrite was prepared, at which a 1 M KOH was added to 500 ml of a 0.2 M Fe(NO3)3 \u2219 9 H2O-solution, until a pH of 7.5 was reached. The developed precipitate was centrifuged and washed for 5 min at 12134 x G, subsequently frozen, freeze-dried, and stored in a desiccator. The mixed Fe-Al-hydroxides were prepared by mixing 0.1 M Fe(NO3)3 \u2219 9 H2O and 0,1 M Al(NO3)3 \u2219 9 H2O were mixed in molar ratios of 1:0, 10:1, 5:1. 1:1, 1:5, 1:10 and 0:1, and brought to a pH of 6 with 5 M KOH. After equilibration for 1 h, the precipitate was centrifuged for 5 min at 12134 x G, washed with ultrapure water, dried at 60\u00b0C, and ground into a powder.\nThe elemental composition of the adsorbents was verified using SEM-EDX, scanning electron microscopy (DSM 962, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (X-Max 50 mm\u00b2 with INCA, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, Great Britain). The final resulting mineral phase of pure Al(OH)3 and FeO(OH) for the amorphous hydroxides was identified. Determination of the minerals crystallization as well as amorphous structures were verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using an Empyrean powder diffractometer (PANalytical, Almelo, Netherlands), with a theta-theta-goniometer, Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.15418 nm), automatic divergent and anti-scatter slits and a PIXcel3D detector. Diffraction data were recorded from 4.6\u00b0 to 84.9\u00b0 2\u03f4 with a step-size of 0.0131, a step time of 58.4 s, and generator settings of 40 kV and 40 mA.\nPrior to desorption, the hydroxides were coated on silica sand (particle size 0.2 \u2013 0.8 mm, Merck Millipore) to ensure a similar sample treatment (e.g. centrifugation times and revolutions). The silica sand used was finely granulated, washed, and calcined. 10 g of the hydroxide in a 0.01 M NaNO3-solution were adjusted to pH 6, resulting in a final volume of 100 ml. 100 g of pure silica sand was added to the suspension, and shaken for 24 h at room temperature. The supernatant was decanted and the material was washed three to five times with the 0.01 M NaNO3-solution at pH 6, and in a final step with ultrapure water to remove hydroxide traces and soluble salts. The coated silica sand was oven dried at 60\u00b0C for 48 h. The silica-hydroxide mixtures were preload with P. Therefore, 200 ml of a 2 mmol l-1 KH2PO4 solution and a 0.01 M CaCl2 background solution were added to the mixtures. After shaking horizontally for 24 h at 150 motions min-1, the hydroxides were centrifuged for 5 min at 929 x G. The supernatant was filtrated and the adsorbed P concentration determined\nDesorption experiments were conducted with CaCl2, CaSO4, humic acid, and citric acid, adjusted to pH 6. 2.5 g of the coated silica sand was treated with 50 ml of 0.01 M CaCl2 or 0.01 M CaSO4. 5 g of the coated silica sand was used for desorption with 50 ml of 2 g l-1 humic acid and citric acid (Alfa Aesar). A concentration of 2 g l-1 for both humic and citric acid was selected to provide a concentration similar to that of the CaCl2 and CaSO4. For desorption experiments, treatment solutions were added to the samples, shaken at 150 motions min-1, and centrifuged for 15 min at 2091 x g.

Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents.

{"text":"Incorporation of flower strips is an agricultural measure to increase aboveground biodiversity and ecosystem services. Although soil communities are key components of terrestrial biodiversity and drive important ecosystem services, their abundance, diversity, and composition in flower strips remain largely unexplored. Here, we shed light on earthworms in flower strips. We sowed a field margin vegetation as well as two annual and two perennial flower strip mixtures in fully randomized plots of 9\u00d728 m in three different types of soil in Germany. Two years following sowing, we determined earthworm communities using chemical extraction. Different plant mixtures (i.e. field margin, annual and perennial flower strip mixtures) harbored distinct earthworm communities. Earthworm density and biomass declined or remained unaffected in annual flower strips but increased in perennial flower strips as compared to the field margin vegetation. We attribute changes in earthworm communities mainly to the effect of tillage and plant diversity.\n\nResearch domain: Ecology of Agricultural Landscapes\n\nResearch question: None","id":"273ccac4-8857-4f59-a10d-bfb73561a78b"}
{"text":"Phosphorus (P) fertilizers and mycorrhiza formation can both significantly improve the P supply of plants, but P fertilizers might inhibit mycorrhiza formation and change the microbial P cycling. To test the dimension and consequences of P fertilizer impacts under maize (Zea mays L.), three fertilizer treatments (1) triple superphosphate (TSP, 21\u201330 kg P ha\u20131 annually), biowaste compost (ORG, 30 Mg ha\u20131 wet weight every third year) and a combination of both (OMI) were compared to a non-P-fertilized control (C) in 2015 and 2016. The test site was a long-term field experiment on a Stagnic Cambisol in Rostock (NE Germany). Soil microbial biomass P (Pmic) and soil enzyme activities involved in P mobilization (phosphatases and \u00df-glucosidase), plant available P content (double lactate-extract; PDL), mycorrhizal colonization, shoot biomass, and shoot P concentrations were determined. P deficiency led to decreased P immobilization in microbial biomass, but the maize growth was not affected. TSP application alone promoted the P uptake by the microbial biomass but reduced the mycorrhizal colonization of maize compared to the control by more than one third. Biowaste compost increased soil enzyme activities in the P cycling, increased Pmic and slightly decreased the mycorrhizal colonization of maize. Addition of TSP to biowaste compost increased the content of PDL in soil to the level of optimal plant supply. Single TSP supply decreased the ratio of PDL:Pmic to 1:1 from about 4:1 in the control. Decreased plant-benefits from mycorrhizal symbiosis were assumed from decreased mycorrhizal colonization of maize with TSP supply. The undesirable side effects of TSP supply on the microbial P cycling can be alleviated by the use of compost. Thus, it can be concluded that the plant-availability of P from soil amendments is controlled by the amendment-specific microbial P cycling and, likely, P transfer to plants. Peine et al.

The objective was to identify grain legume species and cultivars for designing novel cropping systems in north-eastern Germany. The data supports agronomic analyses, as well as dynamic simulation modelling and includes details on crop growth, soil characteristics and weather. In the first part of the experiment different species and cultivars and the effect of irrigation were compared in a split block design with four replicates and the factors species/cultivar and irrigation during five consecutive years (2017-2021). The treatments included eight to 18 species/cultivars depending on the year with soybean, narrow-leafed lupin, white lupin, yellow lupin, faba bean and chickpea. Buckwheat was cultivated as a reference crop. Soybean and lupin seeds were inoculated with HISTICK\u00ae soybean/lupin (BASF, Germany). No fertilizers and conventional crop protection was applied. All lupin species were treated with a natural insecticide against the Sitona weevils. For technical reasons, treatment with this insecticide of field bean, soybean and buckwheat was also unavoidable in some years. Measurements included grain yield, one thousand seed weigh, macro nutrients (N, P, K) in the grain, and additional agronomic observations including number of plants and plant phenology. Irrigation water was applied with a sprinkler system using the Web-BEREST model (Mirschel et al., 2014) to determine the amounts and timing (data on the amounts and dates are provided).

The initial P-concentrations for the adsorption experiments were 150 \u00b5mol l-1, 1000 \u00b5mol l-1 and 2000 \u00b5mol l-1  KH2PO4 for gibbsite and 1000 \u00b5mol l-1, 2000 \u00b5mol l-1 and 5000 \u00b5mol l-1 KH2PO4 for ferrihydrite and the Fe:Al-hydroxides with a 0.01 mol l-1 CaCl2-background electrolyte solution, adjusted to a pH of 6. For P measurements, the gibbsite and ferrihydrite samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 336 \u00d7 G, while the Fe:Al-hydroxide samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 21572 \u00d7 G. The clear supernatant was filtered by using P-poor Whatman 512 1/1 filters.\nThe elemental composition of the adsorbents was verified by using SEM-EDX, scanning electron microscopy (DSM 962, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (X-Max 50 mm\u00b2 with INCA, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, Great Britain). The formation of pure Al(OH)3 and FeO(OH) for the amorphous hydroxides was revealed. Determination of the adsorbent crystallization as well as amorphous structures was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical Empyrean powder diffractometer (Almelo, Netherlands) from GFZ Potsdam, with a theta-theta-goniometer, Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.15418 nm), automatic divergent and anti-scatter slits and a PIXcel3D detector.

{"text":"A central aspect when including catch crops into a crop rotation is the conservation of nutrients in their biomass for the subsequently grown crop. However, the nutrient carry-over to the following crop depends not only on the amount of nutrients accumulated in individual catch crop plant materials but also on the specific degradation properties of their tissues, i.e. the temporal quantitative and qualitative release of scavenged nutrients. In our experiment we investigated the morphological and nutritional response of maize to 6 different pre-grown catch crop variants including pure stands and mixtures. \nAt two field sites in Germany (Asendorf - Lower Saxony and Triesdorf - Bavaria), maize (seeding rate: 9.4 seeds m-2) was established either after pure cultures of mustard, phacelia, bristle oat and Egyptian clover, after a mixture of these 4 species or after a commercial mixture of the DSV with a higher species diversity called TerraLife MaisPro. Their single-species nutrient accumulation was already published in the BonaRes-database under \u201cCatch crop nutrient uptake 1st crop rotation cycle\u201d.  Fallow plots were included as control. Maize was fertilized with 160 kg N ha-1 in Asendorf and 190 kg N ha-1 in Triesdorf. Since nutrient release from catch cops might temporarily vary, we studied the morphological and nutritional response of maize at 4 developmental stages ranging from leaf development over shoot elongation and flowering to cob development. As morphological parameters we investigated the number of leaves, tillers and cobs. In order to study the nutritional response we examined the shoot biomass, chlorophyll content or SPAD values and different nutrient concentrations in young and old leaves as well as the nitrate concentration in the press sap obtained from a 1 cm-piece of the stem base as marker for the nitrogen nutritional status. At both locations, the experiment was repeated in two subsequent years (2016 and 2017) and represented each the initial starting point of a wheat-catch crop-maize long-term rotation. Thus, maize response was tested in total in 4 environments. \nIn general we could not observe any significant impact of the pre-grown catch crop variant on morphological or nutritional shoot parameters at any of the investigated developmental stages and in none of the test environments. However, catch crop effects often develop in the long run when included regularly in a crop rotation.","id":"2dcc638c-6eca-4f91-a860-8ccd5cf3a2ef"}

{"text":"The bone char used for P release experiments was produced by Bonechar Carv\u00e3o Ativado Do Brasil Ltda. (Maring\u00e1, Brazil) in 2015. It has been manufactured by pyrolysis of rendered (de-fatted) bovine bones at more than 800\u00b0C. A particle size analysis of the bone char was carried out, whereby 100 g of char was divided into three particle size fractions:  200 \u00b5m, 200 - 2000 \u00b5m, and 2000 \u00b5m. The P bearing minerals used were the commercially available Ca-phosphate hydroxyapatite (Ca5[OH(PO4)3]) (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) and the Fe-phosphate vivianite (Fe32+[PO4]2 \u00b7 8H2O). Vivianite was prepared where 250 ml of a 0.035 M H3PO4-solution were added to solid FeSO4. The resulting 0.05 M FeSO4-solution was adjusted to pH 6 with 5 M KOH. The precipitate formed was centrifuged for 5 min at 2090 \u00d7 G and washed with ultrapure water. The prepared vivianite was dried at 40\u00b0C and ground into powder using mortar and pestle. P, Ca, and Fe were determined using ICP-AES after pressure digestion or aqua regia digestion.\nThe composition of hydroxyapatite and vivianite was verified using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area was determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome, Odelzhausen, Germany) using a multi-point BET-measurement (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) and N2 as adsorptive medium. The specific surface area of hydroxyapatite was with 68.4 m\u00b2 g-1 1.7 fold higher than for vivianite with 39.5 m\u00b2 g-1. Bone char had the highest specific surface area with values in the range from 92.1 to 94.8 m\u00b2 g-1, increasing with decreasing particle size.\nP release experiments were conducted in triplicate by using a batch setup with an initial pH of 6. For this, 2.5 g of the bone char and the phosphate minerals were weighed into PE bottles. Batch solubilization experiments were performed with CaCl2 (Merck Millipore) and citric acid with the formula C6H8O7 (99 %, Alfa Aesar), adjusted to pH 6 with KOH. These reaction solutions were used in concentrations 0.01 M, 0.05 M, and 0.1 M, respectively. 50 ml reaction solution was added to the bone char samples and 40 ml was added to hydroxyapatite and vivianite samples, respectively. The samples were shaken on a horizontal shaker for 24 h at 200 motions min-1, centrifuged for 15 min at 2090 \u00d7 G, and the supernatant was filtrated by using P-poor Whatman 512 1/2 filters. Following, fresh reaction solution was added to the samples. Samples for P measurement were taken after 2, 6, 24, 48, and 168 h.\nThe cumulative P release based on 168 h with CaCl2 is very low for all used materials. While the total P release for bone char was close to the detection limit, minor P concentrations were measured for vivianite and hydroxyapatite, which increased slightly with increasing CaCl2 concentration. The use of citric acid enabled significantly more P to be solved, whereby an increase of dissolved P with increasing citric acid concentration was measured as well.

{"text":"Ground-based NDVI sensors are vital for an accurate, localized crop condition and growth assessment, but their high cost and labor-intensive nature limit accessibility. Here, we present a low-cost NDVI sensor device, priced under 250 Euros, which can be utilized both manually as a handheld tool and automatically as a standalone device to address this issue. We calibrated and field validated the low-cost NDVI sensor against a commercial sensor for ground-based NDVI measurements. Our calibration revealed a slight underestimation at higher NDVI values measured from the low-cost sensor, which we adjusted using a correction function. Field validation proved the accuracy of low-cost sensor device, with a high correlation (r\u00b2 = 0.99; y = 1.04x + 0.003) and good agreement with the reference device, after applying then derived correction function. Further field trial application of the low-cost sensor as a handheld device (manual mode) in Benin and the Philippines for rice and pineapple cultivation, respectively, demonstrated the reliability of the device to monitor crop development and biomass accumulation. An additional field testing in an oat field site in Germany showed that the developed low-cost NDVI sensor, functioning as a standalone automatic device, is robust, reliable and capable to monitor crop development during senescence, through higher temporal resolution NDVI measurements.

{"text":"We investigate the impacts of increasing plant diversity in catch crop rotations on rhizosphere C input and microbial utilization. Mustard (Sinapis alba L.) planted as a single cultivar was compared to diversified catch crop mixtures of four (Mix4) or 12 species (Mix12). We traced the C transfer from shoots to roots towards the soil microbial community and the soil respiration in a 13C pulse labelling field experiment. The data set included measurements of organic carbon, total nitrogen as well as their stable isotopes in plant and soil material.  The growth and activity of the soil microbiome was investigated by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses. The transferred of C from plants towards the microbiome was measured by 13C label concentration in specific PLFA markers.\n\nMore information is available: Gentsch, N., Boy, J., Batalla, J.D.K. et al.

More specifically, the efficiency for C uptake and the belowground input of recently photosynthesized C products and their partitioning in the rhizosphere was investigated. We hypothesized that diversified catch cropping systems would (I) increase photosynthetic C fixation with higher transport rates of newly assimilated C to the roots, (II) stimulate microbial growth through higher C utilization when C reaches the rhizosphere and (III) prolongate the C cycling throughout the plant-soil-microbiome system.","id":"3139a989-68de-4b85-a786-5c2fd2f0b069"}

{"text":"The mobilization of P and its compounds in arable soils is largely affected by groundwater fluctuations, the amount of precipitation and the associate changes in redox potential (EH) as well as the redox-induced changes of biogeochemical processes. However, those processes are still not fully understood. Thus, we aimed 1) to study the redox induced-release of phosphorus (P) in different arable soil horizons as affected by their properties and the redox potential (EH)-dependent changes on governing factors such as soil pH, Al, Fe, Mn, Ca, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and 2) to examine the impact of addition of carbon sources (rice straw + glucose) on the soil EH/pH changes and on the relevant changes on mobilization of phosphorus in the different soils. We collected top, subsurface, and subsoil horizons from three different soil profiles representing different arable soils originating from Germany, treated the soils with straw + glucose, flooded the treated and untreated soils in triplicates and incubated them for 432 hours. Soil EH, pH, and salinity were measured and soil slurry was collected from all treatments after different incubation times (e., 15 minutes to 432 hours) and analyzed for total dissolved P, PO43-, SO42-, Fe, Al, Fe, Mn, Ca, DIC, and further anions concentrations. Results showed that application of straw and glucose changed significantly soil EH, pH, and total dissolved P content as compared to the untreated soils. Soil EH varied from +194 to +310 mV in the untreated soil and from -520 to +230 mV in the treated soils. Soil pH varied from 6.6 to 7.9 in the untreated soil and from 4.2 to 7.7 in the treated soils. Total dissolved P varied from 0.04 to 0.70 mg/l in the untreated soil and from 0.05 to 10.5 mg/l in the treated soils. Straw + glucose-treated soils exhibited a wider range of EH, a lower pH, and a higher dissolved P content than the un-treated soils. The pH of the treated soils decreased significantly with decreasing soil EH. Total dissolved P in the top soils increased significantly under reducing acidic conditions as compared to the oxidizing alkaline conditions. Our results suggest that the release of P in acidic arable soils rich in organic carbon should be of concern from both agricultural and environmental points of view.","id":"31268e17-675c-4698-b64c-1b257a2ad6e8"}

{"text":"The study focuses on the impact of a beneficial microbial consortium on the plant performance of winter rye under different farming practices during the vegetation period, including the winter growing season. Winter rye plants grown in a long-time field trial (Thy_ABS; 52\u00b015\u2019 N, 13\u00b014\u2019 E, 44 m a.s.l.)  under conventional or organic farming practices were inoculated after plant emergence in autumn 2020 with a beneficial microbial consortium containing Pseudomonas sp. (RU47, drench inoculation with 2 L per m\u00b2 of 7.5 x 107 CFU mL-1), Bacillus atrophaeus (ABi03, drench inoculation with 2 L per m\u00b2 of 7.5 x 107 CFU mL-1) and Trichoderma harzianum (OMG16, soil inoculation with 100 mg inoculum per m\u00b2). The density of the microbial inoculants in the rhizosphere and root-associated soil as well as the plant performance and nutrient status was quantified in autumn and the following spring. Selective plating demonstrated that the beneficial microbes successfully colonized the rhizosphere and root-associated soil of winter rye throughout its early growth cycle. The inoculation with a beneficial microbial consortium enhanced the biomass of winter rye, especially under organic farming practices at the second sampling in spring. The consortium significantly improved the nutrient status of the winter rye plants, providing an effective way to overcome nutrient limitations often found in organic farming.\n\nResearch domain: Plant Cultivation and Agricultural Technology\n\nResearch question: We hypothesized that (i) early inoculation of winter rye enables sufficient colonization of each BMc member at\nearly plant developmental stage, supporting its persistence in the rhizosphere throughout the vegetation period; (ii) the application of BMc shapes the composition of the rhizosphere bacterial community depending on the farming practice and thus differentially affects the plant performance.","id":"31463cb6-8ba6-4e6d-be32-2de9059c85bc"}
{"text":"Soil erosion affects 20% of croplands. However, our understanding of the effect that soil erosion might have on emissions of N2O, which is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, is still limited. This limitation is likely because the small-scale differences in soil properties and fertility induced by erosion (i.e. ranges of erosion states) have barely been considered in studies quantifying N2O emissions from croplands. There are, however, indications that the erosion state itself strongly impacts N2O fluxes, similar to the N fertilizer form. Therefore, our investigations aimed to further explore these indications. The soil and erosion stages of the study area are classified as Albic Luvisols (LVa; non-eroded dry soil), Calcaric Regosol (RGca; extremely eroded dry soil) and Endogleyic Colluvic Regosols (RGco; wet colluvial soil in a depression). \n\n\nThis datasets contains data of soil data, N2O flux obtained from the measurements that were conducted from 03/05/2010 to 03/05/2013 within the hummocky ground moraine landscape of northeastern Germany (CarboZALF-D), modelled N2O flux and Nmin data.

{"text":"This dataset is provided by the SIGNAL subproject \u201cMacrofauna diversity and pest control in temperate agroforestry systems\u201d and contains spider count data from emergence traps of five cropland alley-cropping sites in Northern Germany. Each site comprised a paired alley-cropping agroforestry system (AF) and an adjacent open cropland system (OC) serving as a reference land-use system without trees. At each agroforestry system, four subplots were arranged along linear transects orthogonal to the orientation of the tree rows, with a sampling point at the center of the tree row and at 1, 7, and 24 m (center of the crop row) distance from the tree row edge into the crop row. Open cropland systems had 4 subplots (sampling point) with a minimum distance of 25 m between each other and at least 30 m to the field margins. In total, 20 emergence traps (16 agroforestry, 4 open cropland) were set up at each site. Emergence traps consisted of a white gauze tent covering an area of 0.36 m2 (60 x 60 cm; height: 60 cm) with sides buried 10 cm deep to ensure no exchange between inside and outside. Inside the tents, a pitfall trap (95mm opening diameter, 639 ml volume) and a bottle at the top of the tent were filled with a 50/50 mixture of propylene glycol and water to catch arthropods.

{"text":"In this study, we assessed the influence of above- and belowground diversity, as well as urbanization and plant invasions, on multifunctionality and organic carbon stocks of soils in non-manipulated grasslands along an urbanization gradient in Berlin, Germany. We focused on plant diversity (measured as species richness and functional trait diversity) and, in addition, on soil organism diversity as a potential mediator for the relationship of plant species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results showed positive effects of plant diversity on soil multifunctionality and soil organic carbon stocks along the entire gradient. Structural equation models revealed that plant diversity enhanced soil multifunctionality and soil organic carbon by increasing the diversity of belowground organisms. These positive effects of plant diversity on soil multifunctionality and soil fauna were not restricted to native plant species only, but were also exerted by non-native species, although to a lesser degree. We conclude that enhancing diversity in plants and soil fauna of urban grasslands can increase the multifunctionality of urban soils and also add to their often underestimated but very valuable role in mitigating effects of climate change.","id":"3d41c738-2e57-4c9e-b81f-3a1cd7722f30"}

Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are among these sources and sinks. Furthermore, soil organic matter is a key indicator of soil fertility. The Th\u00fcnen Institute of Climate-Smart Agriculture was commissioned by the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture to conduct the first German agricultural soil inventory and obtain a first representative and consistent baseline of SOC stocks in agricultural soils across Germany. Potential explanatory variables were also assessed. Between 2009 and 2018, a total of 3104 field sites were sampled in a 8x8 km grid (Jacobs et al., 2018). The dataset contains the key data (laboratory and field) of the first German agricultural soil inventory.

In each pot 280 mg of P were added into 6 kg (DM) of an acidic (pH 5.2) sandy silt soil with initially low amounts of available P (24.2 mg kg-1 PCAL). Zero and TSP fertilisation served as control in the completely randomized block experiment with four replicates. An incubation period of between 0 days and 8 weeks in fortnightly steps was implemented. The P uptake of annual rye grass was only slightly influenced by the incubation time of the fertilisers in soil. The relative agronomic efficiency (RAE) shows that MAP performed equally or better than TSP (RAE = 100 %). BCplus had an average RAE of 87 %, with a high variation between the incubation times. The RAE of SSA seemed to decrease constantly with incubation time. SSA, BCplus and MAP seemed all to perform best when applied directly prior to seeding.","id":"4814a13a-92ad-469e-8051-88b8c57328e7"}

{"text":"Scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS) is an algorithm for the normalization of species count data in ecology. So far, SRS has successfully been applied to microbial community data.\n\"SRS is now available on CRAN: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SRS\" \nAn implementation of SRS in R is available for download: https://metadata.bonares.de/smartEditor/rest/upload/ID_7049_2020_05_13_SRS_function_v1_0_R.zip\n\nSRS consists of two steps. In the first step, the counts for all OTUs (operational taxonomic untis) are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts (Cscaled with integer or non-integer values) equals Cmin. In the second step, the non-integer count values are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling. The scaled count Cscaled for each OTU is split into the integer-part Cint by truncating the digits after the decimal separator (Cint = floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cint). Since \u03a3Cint \u2264 Cmin, additional \u2206C = Cmin - \u03a3Cint counts have to be added to the library to reach the total count of Cmin. This is achieved as follows. OTUs are ranked in the descending order of their Cfrac values. Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added counts reaches \u2206C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library equals Cmin. When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking \u2206C counts is shared by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are selected in the order of their Cint values. This selection minimizes the effect of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs. OTUs with identical Cfrag as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement.","id":"4b2b65c6-ff50-4669-99cc-ace343de3548"}

{"text":"The soil fungal community was surveyed across a 52-year chronosequence of soil recultivation after open-mining, during two seasons (March-winter, July-summer). The study sites correspond to agricultural fields located within an area of 25 km 2 (6\u00b015\u20190\u2019 E to 6\u00b021\u20190\u2019 E and 50\u00b050\u20195\u2019 N to 50\u00b053\u20190\u2019 N) of an open-cast lignite mine at Inden, between Cologne, Aachen, M\u00f6nchengladbach, and D\u00fcsseldorf. The soil extraction, deposition and recultivation process leads to a chronosequence of fields recultivated from less than one year to fields recultivated for 52 years, at samling time of 2016. During the first three years, fields are permanently covered by alfalfa and never receive artificial fertilisers or biocide treatments (fields recultivated since 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, referred to as phase 1). In the following two years, agricultural practises are resumed with barley cropping by RWE Power AG, and a N:P:K (1:0.4:0.6) fertilisation of 437 kg ha\u22121 a\u22121 (fields recultivated since 2012 and 2011 referred to as phase 2). Afterwards, fields are returned to farmers and conventionally managed with a crop sequence of winter wheat after sugar beet, one tillage a year to 30 cm depth, and a continuous management practice following area-typical agricultural practice and plant-protection guidelines (fields recultivated since 2006, 1990, 1979, 1971 and 1964, referred to as phase 3). Other agricultural fields that have not yet been subject to extraction were sampled too (referred to as pre-mining phase). They are a total of 115 samples (5 replicates per field x 2 seasons, each field corresponds to a year of recultivation). Four samples were removed due to failed PCR. The soil fungal community was analyzed with 300 bp paired-end Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ITS2 sequences (primers fITS7: 5\u2032\u2010GTGARTCATCGAATCTTTG\u20103\u2032 / ITS4: 5\u2032\u2010TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC\u20103\u2032). Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were inferred using DADA2 in R. Taxonomic annotations were performed using the IDTaxa algorithm implemented in the DECIPHER R package, against UNITE (version of 10.05.2021). Raw sequencing reads are available at ENA under study project PRJEB51095. The DNA sequences of the fungal amplicon sequence variants are available at ENA under accession numbers OV986018-OV989728. The processed dataset including the ASV count table, ASV taxonomy, and sample metadata compiled as a phyloseq R object stored in a single .RDS R file, as well as ASV guild annotation using Funguild database, are available at figshare at (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20160578).

{"text":"In recent years, agricultural machinery became steadily larger and heavier. Especially under wet soil conditions, when soil is susceptible to compaction, heavy wheel load field traffic can lead to harmful soil compaction. This data set contains soil data from a wheeling experiment with agricultural vehicles from the silage maize harvest chain (maize chopper (total weight: ~20 t), tractor with mulcher (total weight: ~12 t), and tractor with silage trailer (total weight: ~32 t)). The experiment was conducted in 2017 on an agricultural test field in Adenstedt (Hildesheim district, Lower Saxony, Germany). The soil type is Stagnic Luvisol derived from Loess and was tilled with a cultivator up to a depth of 25 cm (reduced tillage). For the wheeling experiment, the harvest chain vehicles passed defined plots in the inner field area one after another (8 wheel passes). Maximum soil pressure und plastic soil deformation evoked by vehicle passing was measured simultaneously with a multi-channel device consisting of Bolling probes (Bolling, 1987) and hydrostatic measuring hoses (Nolting et al., 2006). Maximum soil pressure and plastic soil deformation was measured in 20, 35, and 50 cm depth directly below the center of the tires. To investigate changes in soil physical parameters, soil structure, and soil functions caused by harvest chain vehicles driving, undisturbed soil cores (100 cm\u00b3) were taken before (unwheeled) and after wheeling (wheeled). The sampling sites were located in the inner field area. Two soil pits were sampled per wheeling variant. A total of 30 undisturbed soil samples were taken per each soil pit, 10 per each soil depth (20, 35, 50 cm). The soil biopores were counted in every one of the three soil depths. 5 of the 10 undisturbed sampling rings were used to investigate soil water retention and the other 5 for saturated hydraulic conductivity. The determination of pF values was conducted in the soil laboratory using sand and clay boxes as well as pressure pots according to DIN ISO 11274. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was analyzed using a soil water permeameter (open system) according to ISO / FDIS 17312. The soil parameters total pore volume, air capacity, field capacity, usable field capacity, permanent wilting point, dry bulk density, and current water content during soil sampling were derived from the soil laboratory results.","id":"540f1b97-ef14-4f0f-93f6-c2d94f31c94b"}

This data collection consists of 26 individual tables which are related to each other. General description: In organic farms under low yielding site conditions (e.g. sandy soils, dry climate) the size of animal husbandry is frequently restricted by the fact that the site conditions allow for a limited quantity of forage growing only. Some of those farms are even stockless farms. The positive effects of farmyard manure can poorly or not at all be used. Plant based organic fertilizer, e.g. legume biomass or pulse meal, can be an alternative, however, their effects on crop yield and quality and on soil organic matter development has to be carefully studied. This was the objective of the second long-term trial \u201cField E\u201d in Darmstadt, Germany.\nThe experiment was set up in 1996, using a randomized block design with six replicates and 5\u00d75 m experimental plots. A 5 m strip was left between the blocks, which was cropped identically to the experimental plot but remained unfertilized. \nThe experiment consisted of seven treatments: (i) inorganic fertilizers, (ii) plant based organic fertilizer, (iii) plant based organic fertilizer with addition of biodynamic preparations, (iv) cattle farmyard manure, (v) cattle farmyard manure with addition of biodynamic preparations, (vi) high level of cattle farmyard manure, and (vii) high level of cattle farmyard manure with biodynamic preparations.\nFurther details are given by Heinze et al.

{"text":"Heterogenous flow pathways through the soil are a major component in the transport of water, dissolved and particle-bound nutrients like phosphorus (P) to water resources, and promote the eutrophication of water bodies. Non-uniform water flow patterns may also influence the spatial variability of the P-content in soils. \nThis study was designed to understand the spatial distribution of P in agriculturally used soils and the mechanism causing P accumulation and depletion at the centimeter scale. We conducted three replicate dye tracer experiments using Brilliant Blue on a loamy Stagnosol in North-Eastern-Germany. The plant-available phosphorus of stained and unstained areas was analyzed using double lactate extraction (DL-P) and diffusive gradients on thin films (DGT-P). \nThe DL-P and the DGT-P were strongly correlated (p0.001, R\u00b2=0.63) confirming that DL-P is a good measure for the mobile phase of soil P. \nThe plant available P contents of the topsoil were significantly higher than those of the subsoil in all three replicates. The topsoil\u2019s stained areas showed higher P contents than unstained areas, while the opposite was found for the subsoil. The P contents varied strongly over the soil profiles (0.4 to 11.2 mg P 100 g-1) and different categories of flow patterns (matrix flow, flow fingers, preferential flow and no flow). The P contents of these flow patterns differed significantly from each other and followed the order: Pmatrix flow  Pfinger flow  Pno flow  Ppreferential flow.","id":"54ecbb64-7cc4-46d2-957d-d37e957daf98"}

{"text":"Acceptability of novel bone char fertilizers depends on their P release but reactions at bone char surfaces and impacts to soil P speciation are insufficiently known. By sequential fractionation and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy we investigated whether and how the chemical composition of bone char particles has been altered in soil and, consequently, has affected the P speciation of amended soils. Therefore, two different kinds of bone char particles (BC, produced by pyrolysis of degreased animal bone chips at 800 \u00baC and BCplus, a BC enriched with reduced sulfur compounds) were manually separated from the soil at the end of two different experiments: \u201cincubation-leaching\u201d and \u201cryegrass cultivation\u201d. Sequential P-fractionation of amended soils showed P-enrichment in all fractions as compared to the control. The most P increase between all treatments significantly occurred in the NaOH-P and resin-P fractions in response to BCplus application in both, incubation-leaching and ryegrass cultivation experiments. This increase of the readily available P fraction in BCplus treated soils was confirmed by linear combination fitting (LCF) analysis on P K-edge XANES spectra of BCs particles and amended soils. The proportion of Ca-hydroxyapatite decreased, whereas the proportion of CaHPO4 increased in BCplus particles after amended soils had been incubated and leached and cropped by ryegrass. Based on P-XANES speciation as determined by LCF analysis, the proportion of inorganic Ca(H2PO4)2 increased in amended soils after BCplus application. These results indicated that soil amendment with BCplus particles leads to elevated P concentration and maintains more soluble P species than BC particles even after 230-days of ryegrass cultivation.

There are several studies in the literature with the aim of finding the best method to assess and map the distribution of SOC content for Europe. This study aims to search for the effects and performances of using aggregated soil samples coming from different studies and land-uses.\nThe total number of the soil samples in this study was 23,835 and they were collected from the \u201cLand Use/Cover Area frame Statistical Survey\u201d (LUCAS) Project (samples from agricultural soil), the BioSoil Project (samples from forest soil), and the \u201cSoil Transformations in European Catchments\u201d (SoilTrEC) Project (samples from local soil data coming from five different critical zone observatories (CZOs) in Europe). Moreover, 15 spatial indicators (slope, aspect, elevation, compound topographic index (CTI), CORINE land-cover classification, parent material, texture, world reference base (WRB) soil classification, geological formations, annual average temperature, min-max temperature, total precipitation and average precipitation (for the years 1960\u20131990 and 2000\u20132010)) were used as auxiliary variables in this prediction. One of the most popular geostatistical techniques, Regression-Kriging (RK), was applied to build the model and assess the distribution of SOC.\nThis study showed that, even though the RK method was appropriate for successful SOC mapping, using combined databases did not increase the statistical significance of the method results for assessing the SOC distribution as much as expected. Combining local data coming from CZOs with LUCAS samples was found as more significant than combining the two big datasets of the LUCAS and Biosoil Projects. Moreover, the effect of the chosen auxiliary variables on SOC prediction seems more important than increasing the number of the soil samples. According to the results: SOC variation was mainly affected by elevation, slope, CTI, average temperature, average and total precipitation, texture, WRB and CORINE variables at the European scale in the model. Moreover, the highest average SOC contents were found in the wetland areas; agricultural areas have much lower SOC content than forest and semi natural areas; Ireland, Sweden and Finland show the highest SOC values; Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Spain and Italy show the lowest values with an average 3%.\n\u00a0\nData (available: 3 output datasets and 1 input dataset):\n0. \u00a0 \u00a0 Input: soil sample point data; attribute: SOC for each point.\n1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Predicted distribution of SOC content by using 1 dataset (LUCAS) (Figure 3 in the article)\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Predicted distribution of SOC content by using 2 datasets (LUCAS-CZOs) (Figure 4 in the article)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Predicted distribution of SOC content by using 3 datasets (LUCAS-CZOs-BIOSOIL) (Figure 5 in the article)\n\u00a0\nAcknowledgments\nFunding support is acknowledged from the European Commission FP 7 Collaborative Project \u201cSoil Transformations in European Catchments\u201d (SoilTrEC) (Grant Agreement no. 244118).","id":"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu//content/predicted-distribution-soc-content-europe-based-lucas-biosoil-and-czo-context-eu-funded-1"}

{"text":"We present a comprehensive, high-quality dataset characterising soil-vegetation and land-surface processes from continuous measurements conducted in two climatically contrasting study regions in South West Germany: the warmer and drier Kraichgau region with a mean temperature of 9.7\u00b0C and annual precipitation of 890 mm, and the cooler and wetter Swabian. Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content.

{"text":"We present a comprehensive, high-quality dataset characterising soil-vegetation and land-surface processes from continuous measurements conducted in two climatically contrasting study regions in South West Germany: the warmer and drier Kraichgau region with a mean temperature of 9.7\u00b0C and annual precipitation of 890 mm, and the cooler and wetter Swabian. Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes.

{"text":"Within the EIP-AGRI-funded project \u201cpH-BB: Precision liming in Brandenburg\u201d, research was conducted on improving the management of soil acidity on farms in the federal state of Brandenburg (Germany). With the help of mobile proximal soil sensors, the lime-relevant soil parameters pH value, texture and soil organic matter were recorded time-saving, cost-effectively and on a small scale. Regulations for processing the sensor data and deriving fertilization recommendations were developed. An important sub-step in determining the lime requirement is the site-specific calibration of the sensor data in order to obtain high-resolution maps of the lime-relevant soil parameters. For this purpose, soil samples were taken from all mapped plots and analyzed for pH, soil organic carbon and grain size distribution. The analyzed results of the first out of three participating farms in the project are available in this data set. Furthermore, in addition to the analysis of the pH value, a basic soil investigation was carried out determining the plant-availability of phosphorus, potassium and magnesium. To date, the dataset consists of a total of 599 entries for pH, 508 for soil organic carbon, total carbon and total nitrogen content, 581 for P, K and Mg, and 374 for soil texture (clay, fine silt, medium silt, coarse silt, fine sand, medium sand, coarse sand).

Half hourly evapotranspiration rates were calculated as a residual of the net radiation, the sensible heat flux and the ground heat flux. Besides the latter energy balance components, also standard meteorological data, such as global radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and -direction and precipitation were continuously measured since April 2016. All instruments were installed at a 3.5 m tall weather mast and the data were automatically collected. The weather mast was installed at the reference plot of Dornburg (Thuringia). That plot is treated as conventional agriculture, in this case crop land.

The initiator of this series of trials was Eduard von Boguslawski, who also foundedthe international working group \"IOSDV\". The LTE \"IOSDV\" in Rauischholzhausen was later continued and managed by Bernd Honermeier (1996 - 2021).\n\nThe original idea of this LTE was to compare three farming systems (farm types), (1) system without organic fertilisation (simulating a cash crop farm), (2) system with organic fertilisation from livestock (farmyard manure, simulating a farm with livestock) and (3) system with organic fertilisation from plant residues (straw, catch crops and digestate from a biogas plant). In these arable farming systems, the classic cash crops sugar beet (since 2010 silage maize), winter wheat and winter barley are grown in a crop rotation (one after the other in time) and at the same time also next to each other every year. Due to the central importance of nitrogen as a plant nutrient, mineral N fertilisation was included as a test factor and combined with all other test factors in four different dosages so that possible interactions could be investigated. Since the LTE was set up at several locations, the influence of site and climatic conditions on soil properties and plant yields as a function of organic and mineral N fertilisation can also be investigated. \n\nThe trial was extended in 1997 by a variant with \"compost fertilisation\"  (without and with certified compost), with the same crop rotation and mineral N fertilisation.\n\nLand Use Type: Field crops\nResearch Theme: Fertilization\nLTE Category: Fertilization\nFarming Category: Conventional\n\nResearch Parameter: \n-Plant: total biomass yield, grain yield, harvest index\n-Soil: Ct, Corg, Nt, nitrate N\n\nFactors:\n- Factor A: Crops (sugar beet/maize, winter wheat, winter barley)\n- Factor B: N-fertilization (5 levels)\n- Factor C: Organic fertilization (3 levels)\n\nResearch question: The trial aims to clarify the long-term effects of different organic fertilisation (manure from livestock compared to organic matter from plants) on soil properties  (Ct/Corg, Nt, Nmin) and on biomass yields of maize, winter wheat and winter barley.

{"text":"Metadata\nTitle: Soil Loss by Water Erosion in EuropeDescription: At a resolution of 100m, this is the most detailed assessment yet of soil erosion by water for the EU. The study applied a modified version of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model, RUSLE 2015, which delivers improved estimates based on higher resolution (100 m compared to 1 km) peer-reviewed inputs of rainfall, soil, topography, land use and management from the year 2010 (the latest year for which most of the input factors are estimated). The model can be used to predict the effect of a range of policy scenarios. It is also replicable, comparable and can be extended to model other regions. All the input layers (Rainfall erosivity, Soil Erodibility, Cover-Management, Topography and Support Practices) have been peer reviewed and published as well.Spatial Coverage: European Union 28 Member StatesResolution: 100mTime Reference:\u00a0 2010, 2016Format: Raster (Grid)Projection: ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal AreaInput data: LUCAS Topsoil, European Soil Database, Lucas Earth Observations, Rainfall Erosivity Database at European Scale (REDES), CORINE Land Cover 2006, COPERNICUS Remote Sensing, EUROSTAT (statistics on Crops, Tillage, Plant residues, cover crops), Digital Elevation Model (DEM) at 25m, Good Agricultural Environmental Condition (GAEC).More Information: RUSLE2015Additional data: Rainfall erosivity (R-factor), Soil Erodibility (K-factor), Topography (LS-factor), Cover Management (C-factor), Support Practices (P-factor) data are also available for download in the corresponding pages.Release Date: 1/9/2015\nSoil erosion by water is one of the major threats to soils in the European Union, with a negative impact on ecosystem services, crop production, drinking water and carbon stocks. The European Commission\u2019s Soil Thematic Strategy has identified soil erosion as a relevant issue for the European Union, and has proposed an approach to monitor soil erosion. A recent published paper presents the application of a modified version of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model (RUSLE2015) to estimate soil loss in Europe for the reference year 2010, within which the input factors (Rainfall erosivity, Soil erodibility, Cover-Management, Topography, Support practices) are modelled with the most recently available pan-European datasets. While RUSLE has been used before in Europe, RUSLE2015 improves the quality of estimation by introducing updated (2010), high-resolution (100 m), peer-reviewed input layers. The mean soil loss rate in the European Union\u2019s erosion-prone lands (agricultural, forests and semi-natural areas) was found to be 2.46 t ha-1 yr-1, resulting in a total soil loss of 970 Mt annually. A major benefit of RUSLE2015 is that it can incorporate the effects of policy scenarios based on land-use changes and support practices. The impact of the Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) requirements of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the EU\u2019s guidelines for soil protection can be grouped under land management (reduced/no till, plant residues, cover crops) and support practices (contour farming, maintenance of stone walls and grass margins). The policy interventions (GAEC, Soil Thematic Strategy) over the past decade have reduced the soil loss rate by 9.5% on average in Europe, and by 20% for arable lands. Special attention is given to the 4 * 106 ha of croplands which currently have unsustainable soil loss rates of more than 5 t ha-1 yr-1, and to which policy measures should be targeted. A correspondence article \"Common Agricultural Policy: Tackling soil loss across Europe\" has also been publihed in Nature (October 2015).\nNote: An update of the soil erosion indicator took place for the year 2016 and the results have been published in the paper A Soil Erosion Indicator for Supporting Agricultural, Environmental and Climate Policies in the European Union. Compared to the assessment for 2010, we estimate a very decrease of soil loss by water erosion (<1%) due to a limited increase of applied soil conservation practices and land cover change observed at the EU level. The modelling results suggest that, currently, ca. 25% of the EU land has erosion rates higher than the recommended sustainable threshold (2 t ha\u22121 yr\u22121 ) and more than 6% of agricultural lands suffer from severe erosion (11 t ha\u22121 \u00a0yr\u22121 ).","id":"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu//content/soil-erosion-water-rusle2015"}

Furthermore, the Fusarium and Alternaria infection on wheat ears in the transition zones between kettle hole edge and field and field edge and field in July 2019 and 2020 were determined. 10 different kettle holes and 6 different field edges each year were selected and transects were build up into the field (up to 50m). Fusarium and Alternaria abundance in the transition zones were analyzed by qPCR with extracted DNA out of dried and ground samples. Furthermore, Fusarium species diversity was analyzed by culture-dependent methods using kernels of the wheat ears collected at each sampling point.This table contains the index of all tables forming this data collection.\n\nRelated datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.\nDataset version 1.0","id":"616f4686-078a-4d60-9fd5-3629389010a1"}

{"text":"During the last decades, organic farming has undergone a notable expansion as a common agricultural practice throughout the world. This, together with an increasing demand for fertilizer and pesticide reduction has led to consider different and new approaches. We investigate the effect of Hartmannibacter diazotrophicus strain E19, a plant growth promoting rhizobacterium, in order to enhance the production of wheat and barley under low energy input. For that, we analyze the effect of three factors: organic fertilizer (with and without, only wheat), row distance (15 cm and 50 cm), and bacterial inoculation (E19 and control) at two different organic experimental field stations (Gladbacherhof and Kleinhohenheim). The dataset provides information about different parameter determined from rhizosphere soil and root samples collected at two different developmental stages (flowering and milk/fully ripe), as well as, the grain yield, straw yield, 1000 kernel mass, and seed quality during the seasons 2020-2021 and 2021-2022. The following soil parameter were evaluated: ammonium, nitrate, carbon-nitrogen ratio, microbial biomass, the respiration activity using different carbon sources (glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, arginine). These data sets are currently under evaluation and complemented with the quantification of strain E19 from root samples through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and the metabarcoding sequencing of the bacterial communities based on 16S rRNA genes obtained from rhizosphere soil samples during the two seasons. \nData obtained for wheat quality are yield parameter (grain yield, straw yield, thousand kernel mass), protein concentration, different fractions of protein (albumin concentration, albumin percentage, gliadin concentration, gliadin percentage, glutenin concentration, glutenin percentage, gluten concentration, gluten percentage, gliadin to glutenin ratio), protein subtractions (\u03c9-gliadin, \u03b3_gliadin, \u03b1/\u03b2_gliadin, HMW, D_LMW, B_LMW, C_LMW, total LMW, HMW/LMW ratio), baking parameters (water absorption, baking loss 1 hour , loaf volume, hardness after 1 hour, hardness after 7 days, freshness retention, springiness after 1 hour, springiness after 7 days, elasticity), cations such as Fe ,Zn, Mg, K, Ca, and important metabolites such as proline, amylose and total starch were determined in order to evaluate the effect of the different factors mentioned above. \nFor barley quality, yield parameter (grain yield, straw yield, thousand kernel mass), protein concentration, different fractions of grain storage protein (albumin concentration, albumin percentage, hordein concentration, hordein percentage, glutelin concentration glutelin percentage), protein subtractions (proteinZ, C-hordein, B-hordein, Y-hordein, HMW, D_LMW, B_LMW, C_LMW, total_LMW, HMW/LMW ratio), Fe , Zn, Mg, K, Ca, proline, amylose and total starch were determined in order to evaluate the effect of the different factors.

{"text":"In recent years, agricultural machinery became steadily larger and heavier. Especially under wet soil conditions, when soil is susceptible to compaction, heavy wheel load field traffic can lead to harmful soil compaction. This data set contains soil data from a wheeling experiment with an agricultural vehicle (3-axle sugar beet harvester). The experiment was conducted in 2016 on an agricultural test field in Adenstedt (Hildesheim district, Lower Saxony, Germany). The soil type is Stagnic Luvisol derived from Loess and was tilled with a cultivator up to a depth of 25 cm (reduced tillage). For the wheeling experiment, the harvester passed defined plots in the field with a full bunker (total weight: 62 t) and a half full bunker (total weight: 49 t). Maximum soil pressure and plastic soil deformation evoked by harvester passing was measured simultaneously with a multi-channel device consisting of Bolling probes (Bolling, 1987) and hydrostatic measuring hoses (Nolting et al., 2006). Maximum soil pressure and plastic soil deformation was measured in 20, 35, and 50 cm depth directly below the center of the tires. To investigate changes in soil physical parameters, soil structure, and soil functions caused by harvester driving, undisturbed soil cores (100 cm\u00b3) were taken before (unwheeled) and after wheeling (wheeled). Wheeling variants in the inner field area were sugar beet harvester with half full bunker and full bunker volume driving with all wheels in the same track (3 wheel passes). The wheeling variant of the headland area was sugar beet harvester with full bunker volume and multiple wheel passes in front of the sugar beet clamp. The sampling sites were located both in the inner field area and in the headlands. Two soil pits were sampled per wheeling variant in the inner field area and one soil pit in the headlands. A total of 30 undisturbed soil samples were taken per each soil pit, 10 per each soil depth (20, 35, 50 cm). The soil biopores were counted in every one of the three soil depths. 5 of the 10 undisturbed sampling rings were used to investigate soil water retention and the other 5 for saturated hydraulic conductivity. The determination of pF values was conducted in the soil laboratory using sand and clay boxes as well as pressure pots according to DIN ISO 11274. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was analyzed using a soil water permeameter (open system) according to ISO / FDIS 17312. The soil parameters, total pore volume, air capacity, field capacity, usable field capacity, permanent wilting point, dry bulk density, and current water content during soil sampling were derived from the soil laboratory results.\n\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences","id":"65c50647-b035-43a5-b1aa-1f03c6f8ee2e"}

{"text":"We present a comprehensive, high-quality dataset characterising soil-vegetation and land-surface processes from continuous measurements conducted in two climatically contrasting study regions in South West Germany: the warmer and drier Kraichgau region with a mean temperature of 9.7\u00b0C and annual precipitation of 890 mm, and the cooler and wetter Swabian. Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents. One station in each region has now been set up as continuous observatories of state variables and fluxes in intensively managed agricultural fields.\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences\nThe corresponding publication can be accessed here:\u00a0https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2020-396\u00a0\nDataset version 1.1  This table contains Site 3 soil data.\n\nRelated datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.","id":"6a29484a-948d-4b83-ab86-358d0a9a1a3a"}

{"text":"Grassland is a precious good. Grassland contributes to food security by providing fodder for dairy and beef farming, storing nutrients and increasing biodiversity. These functions that secure the fertility and yields of soil are jeopardized by climate change, especially in monane and alpine areas.\nIn SUSALPS, scientists, authorities and farmers work together to investigate the influence of climate change on i) plant biodiversity, ii) C and N storage, iii) greenhouse gas exchange, iv) socio economic conditions that influence decision making of farmers.\nA central experimental aspect is the translocation of soil mesocosms from higher elevation to lower elevation (Esterberg site at 1200m, Graswang site at 860m, Fendt at 600m, Bayreuth at 300m). To reflect the spatial heterogeneity of soils, mesocosms from three different subplots approx. 100-300m apart from each other are translocated.
