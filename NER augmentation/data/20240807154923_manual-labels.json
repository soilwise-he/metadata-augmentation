Non-invasive imaging techniques have recently been used to investigate the development of root system architecture over time, but the relationship with soil deformation is usually neglected. Correlative mapping approaches parameterised using 2D and 3D image data have recently gained prominence for quantifying physical deformation in composite materials including fibre-reinforced polymers and trabecular bone. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) are computational techniques which use the inherent material texture of surfaces and volumes, captured using imaging techniques, to map full-field deformation components in samples during physical loading.<br/><br/>Here we develop an experimental assay and methodology for four-dimensional, in vivo X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) and apply a Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) approach to the data to quantify deformation. The method is validated for a field-derived soil under conditions of uniaxial compression, and a calibration study is used to quantify thresholds of displacement and strain measurement. The validated and calibrated approach is then demonstrated for an in vivo test case in which an extending maize root in field-derived soil was imaged hourly using XCT over a growth period of 19 h. This allowed full-field soil deformation data and 3D root tip dynamics to be quantified in parallel for the first time.<br/><br/>This method paves the way for comparative studies of contrasting soils and plant genotypes, improving our understanding of the fundamental mechanical processes which influence root system development."

        "text": "Fusion of Vis-NIR and XRF spectra for estimation of key soil attributes || Abstract   Precision agriculture (PA) is an integrated solution to optimize the application of farming inputs site-specifically to increase crops efficiency, reduce resources consumption, and protect the environment. Recently, visible-near- infrared (Vis-NIR) and X-ray-fluorescence (XRF) have emerged as efficient and inexpensive proximal soil sensing (PSS) methods for assessment of soil attributes in support of PA applications. The goal of this study was to explore the potential of data fusion in accuracy improvement of predicting key soil attributes using Vis-NIR and XRF spectra. More specifically, local weighted regression (LWR) and partial least squares (PLS) regression methods were examined and compared in prediction of the following soil attributes: pH, organic carbon (OC), phosphorous (P), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and sodium (Na). Besides the individual-sensor models, we evaluated three data fusion approaches basedon spectra fusion (SF). The first method concatenates the full Vis-NIR and XRF spectra before PLS (SF1-PLS). In the second SF approach (SF2-PLS), the concatenation of the principal components (PCs) of the two spectra types \u2013 each resulted from a principal component analysis (PCA) \u2013 were used as input to PLS. The last proposed method, SF-CNN, uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with input in form of a matrix whose columns are the PCs of the Vis-NIR and the PCs of the XRF spectra. To evaluate the proposed methods, a total 267 soil samples of nine arable fields were collected and scanned in laboratory settings using a Vis-NIR and an XRF spectrometer. For each soil attribute, the samples of six fields were used as the calibration set while the samples of the remaining three fields were used for validating the prediction models. The individual-sensor and SF models were evaluated in terms of ratio of performance to inter-quartile (RPIQ), root mean square error (RMSE), and Lin\u2019s concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC). The validation results showed that PLS generally outperforms LWR. Also, the prediction accuracy obtained from Vis-NIR spectra was better than that of XRF for all the attributes, except for Ca. The proposed SF schemes, especially the SF-CNN, outperformed the individual models in the prediction of all attributes, except P and Ca. The best improvement of the prediction results, compared to the individual-sensor models, was obtained for Mg (RPIQ\u00a0=\u00a01.60, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a06.88\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g, LCCC\u00a0=\u00a00.93), successively followed by pH (RPIQ\u00a0=\u00a02.52, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a00.36, LCCC\u00a0=\u00a00.68), and Na (RPIQ\u00a0=\u00a01.69, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a02.55\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g, LCCC\u00a0=\u00a00.65). Overall, the results of this study suggest the CNN-based fusion for the prediction of the studied key soil fertility attributes in order to enable making accurate decisions and control loop in PA applications using high-resolution data on spatiotemporal variability of soil."

The HYDRUS-1D simulations were performed at daily time step during the two growing seasons: 2002/2003 and 2015/2016. The model was firstly calibrated based on one field 'denoted F1' data during the 2002/2003 cropping season by using the Levenberg-Marquardt method implemented in HYDRUS-1D model for optimizing various parameters of Van Genuchten equation that provide the minimum difference between measured and simulated soil moisture at four layers of soil (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 cm). Afterwards, the model validation was done based on the data from four fields of wheat: two fields 'denoted F2 and F3' during the 2002/2003 and two other fields 'denoted F4 and F5' during the 2015/2016 cropping season. All fields were irrigated with flooding system except the field F5 where drip irrigation was undertaken. In-situ measurements of \u03b8 was carried out using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) and gravimetric method ETa was measured by the Eddy Covariance system Ta and Ea were monitored using a lysimeter in F5 field. The results showed that the HYDRUS-1D model simulates the \u03b8, ETa, Ta and Ea reasonably well. Additionally, the evaluation of the irrigation system on DP losses was investigated by comparing the simulation results over flood (F4) and drip (F5) irrigated fields. It was found that about 56% and 20% of seasonal supplied water were lost by DP in F4 and F5 sites, respectively. Such unexpected high amount of DP taking place in F5 field is due to the improper use of the drip irrigation system.."

Nevertheless, understanding of the formation and composition of these compounds remains limited, or even inconsistent. This hampers full comprehension of the risks and impacts elicited by fluorine-rich ash emissions after an explosive eruption. The 2010 activity of Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland was characterised by contrasted eruptive styles - phreatomagmatic and magmatic - which produced ash deposits with distinct soluble F\u2212 contents. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and leachate analyses of Eyjafjallajokull ash materials, we infer the existence of silicon hexafluoride salts, particularly Na2SiF6, dominantly if not exclusively on the magmatic ash, and suggest a reaction mechanism for their formation. The presence of Na2SiF6 explains the much greater F\u2212 concentration and higher acidity measured in leachates of the magmatic ash compared to those of the phreatomagmatic ash. River waters affected by ash deposition during the magmatic activity showed a temporary increase in F\u2212 and decrease in dissolved silicon isotope values (\u03b430Si). We contend that the formation of silicon hexafluoride salts on ash leads to a surface enrichment of the ash's silicate glass and mineral components in 28Si, with the release of this light Si from the magmatic ash during the early stage of weathering causing a depression in the riverine \u03b430Si. This supports existing evidence of silicate dissolution processes being influenced by the presence of fluorine. Our study also points to the likely important role of Na2SiF6 in modulating the environmental and health effects of ash emissions from fluorine-rich magmatic eruptions."
