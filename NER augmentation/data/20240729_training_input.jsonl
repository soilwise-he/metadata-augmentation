{"text":"Our study reveals the effects of GCFs on a soil-crop system: in general, with an increasing number of GCFs, soil properties, and plant biomass reacted negatively. For example, the higher the level of GCFs, the lower the plant biomass and soil water stable aggregation. We also find that MP applied as a single factor had minimal effects on soil properties and crop growth. However, when combined with other individual factors, it significantly altered the effect size, sometimes even causing directional change. Our results revealed that the interaction between MP and other GCFs is not an additive response. Due to the characteristics of MP, the interaction mechanism between heavy metal and MP is obviously different from the response between drought and MP, and their combined effects on the soil-plant system may fundamentally vary Factor interactions are key to understanding and predicting how GCFs influence soil and plants. With an increasing number of GCFs involved, it becomes more and more complicated to predict effects on ecosystems. Our study is among the first to systematically examine how microplastic acts in combination with a range of other important environmental drivers, and thus offers a first step toward understanding these elusive interactive effects.","id":"0007bad6-848d-4763-9813-d5ed21cde6ee"}

{"text":"The dataset contains the yearly number of climatic compound events in the 96 counties of Bavaria between 1981 and 2021 in the development phases of maize and winter wheat. Compound events are defined as multiple extreme events occurring together, in this case, heat (high temperatures) and drought (low precipitation). Climatic values are considered extreme if they are higher (or lower in the case of precipitation) than certain thresholds. The thresholds were defined via the percentiles of values in the climatically more stable reference period between 1951 and 1980. The temperature and precipitation values were obtained from the weather stations run by the German Meteorological Service (DWD). For the study period 1981 \u2013 2021, they were brought on the spatial scale of the Bavarian counties via Thiessen-Polygons. For the reference period, the values were not differentiated spatially but applied for whole Bavaria which leads to a higher number of extreme events in dryer regions. Temporally, the extreme events were differentiated for the development phases of maize and winter wheat. The percentiles were applied to the climatic values from the whole development phases (May \u2013 October for maize, November \u2013 July for winter wheat, always for the whole months), the vegetative phase (May \u2013 July for maize, November \u2013 April for winter wheat), and the reproductive phase (August \u2013 October for maize, May \u2013 July for winter wheat). To account for the water storage in the soil, in addition to the precipitation of one day, extremes of the precipitation sums of this day with the 9, 19, and 29 preceding days were calculated as well. Multiple extreme events were defined as compound events when they fall together in the same county and on the same day. These compound events were calculated in five severity levels depending on the applied percentiles (above the 95th percentile for temperature values and below the 10th percentile for precipitation as the most severe level, followed by the 90th and 20th, 85th and 30th, 80th and 40th, as well as the 75th and 50th percentile). From the daily compound events, finally, the yearly sums were built for each county. The first column of the dataset describes from how many days the precipitation sum was built, in which development phases the compound events lie, and with which severity level. For each of these 120 combinations, the values for the years 1981 \u2013 2021 in the 96 counties are given.

{"text":"Apple replant disease (ARD) is a threat to apple fruit and tree production worldwide caused by shifts in the soil microbiome. Chemical and physical measures of soil disinfection are the most employed countermeasures but inter-row plantings demonstrate that ARD is widely immobile in the soil, which causes the plant to face ARD affected and healthy soil simultaneously in the field. We simulated this situation in a split-root approach in two experiments using rhizoboxes, soil from the ORDIAmur ARD references sites Heidgraben and Ellerhoop and the apple rootstock M26. Root growth was monitored via the transparent front panel of the rhizoboxes and shoot growth was measured weekly. After two weeks, root systems from a subset of plants were sampled for expression analysis of ARD candidate genes. After eight weeks, masses of roots and shoots were recorded and contents of selected phenolic compounds were analyzed.\nRoot and shoot growth were severely reduced whenever both compartments of the rhizobox were filled with ARD soil in comparison to both compartments filled with disinfected ARD soil. Plants with only half of the root system growing in ARD soil showed a local reduction in root growth with an intermediate shoot growth. In ARD affected roots, the expression of the three ARD biomarker genes, biphenyl synthase 3, biphenyl 4-hydroxylase and ethylene-responsive transcription factor 1B-like, was locally induced after two weeks in comparison to disinfected ARD or control soil. Phenolic compound profiles in the roots showed a high variation between samples and soils. The total phenolic content as well as the contents of epicatechin and an unknown phenolic compound were locally increased in roots grown in ARD soil in comparison to disinfected ARD soil after eight weeks. Our results show how apple plants focus their molecular defense towards ARD locally in the roots. The local nature of ARD presents both challenges in the assessment of ARD severity in the field as for possible management strategies involving soil tillage.\n\nResearch domain: Plant Breeding\n\nResearch question: The objectives of this study were (i) to link the previously observed localized growth response to a local response of the selected genes and phenolic metabolites and (ii) identify the phenolic compounds that can be useful in unraveling ARD.","id":"03a597e4-004f-45e1-b18a-78ca607b51e4"}

This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents.

The V140 is around 0.5 ha and is located on a flat area. Before the establishment of V140 the site was cultivated uniformly. According to the German Guidelines Soil Assessment (Bodensch\u00e4tzung) the dominating soil types are slightly loamy sand and sand (Sl4D and S4D). The most common soil sub type is Haplic Luvisol.

The search was restricted to articles in English published between January 2014 and January 2019. We identified 227 articles, out of which 179 met our selection criteria. Using a full-text review, we extracted information on ecosystem services addressed and indicators used. We also recorded the type of input data used and the spatial scale the indicators were used at or recommended for. Where studies used ecosystem service definitions other than the Common International Classification of Ecosystem Services (CICES V.5.1), indicators were assigned to the corresponding CICES class or classes. We used the information derived from the review to create factsheets for 37 ecosystem services relevant to agricultural land and soil management. Each factsheet provides tables with available indicators applicable at spatial scales ranging from field to global, information on the type of input data required and a link to the complete bibliographic information of the article or articles the indicator was taken from. Since the dataset is based on a systematic sample of publications on ecosystem service supply, it indicates the current research focus and research gaps.

{"text":"Drainage and agricultural use transform natural peatlands from a net carbon (C) sink to a net C source. Rewetting of peatlands, despite of high methane (CH4) emissions, holds the potential to mitigate climate change by greatly reducing CO2 emissions. However, the time span for this transition is unknown because most studies are limited to a few years. Especially, non-permanent open water areas often created after rewetting, are highly productive. Here, we present 14 consecutive years of CH4 flux measurements following rewetting of a formerly long-term drained peatland in the Peene valley. Measurements were made at two rewetted sites (non-inundated vs. inundated) using manual chambers. During the study period, significant differences in measured CH4 emissions occurred. In general, these differences overlapped with stages of ecosystem transition from a cultivated grassland to a polytrophic lake dominated by emergent helophytes, but could also be additionally explained by other variables. This transition started with a rapid vegetation shift from dying cultivated grasses to open water floating and submerged hydrophytes and significantly increased CH4 emissions. Since 2008, helophytes have gradually spread from the shoreline into the open water area, especially in drier years. This process was periodically delayed by exceptional inundation and eventually resulted in the inundated site being covered by emergent helophytes. While the period between 2009 and 2015 showed exceptionally high CH4 emissions, these decreased significantly after cattail and other emergent helophytes became dominant at the inundated site. Therefore, CH4 emissions declined only after ten years of transition following rewetting, potentilly reaching a new steady state. Overall, this study highlights the importance of an integrative approach to understand the shallow lakes CH4 biogeochemistry, encompassing the entire area with its mosaic of different vegetation forms. This should be ideally done through a study design including proper measurement site allocation as well as long-term measurements.

{"text":"Current efforts to enhance the agroecosystems carbon (C) sink function for climate mitigation faced challenges, particularly with traditional measures having limited suitability for increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks.  One way out of this dilemma could be to create an additional stable soil C sink by inducing SOC under saturation in the topsoil. In the past, attempts were made by abrupt topsoil dilution through subsoil admixture by means of deep tillage but with varying degrees of success. This was partly due to a lack of knowledge about the impact of soil condition like erosion state and N fertilization form ensuring optimum C input into the soil on the desired additional SOC accumulation and partly due to the lack of suitable experimental approaches to record the effect of all relevant factors simultaneously. To help solve these problems, a three-factorial experimental field trial were established: I.) \"moderate topsoil dilution\" (diluted vs non-diluted), II.) \"N fertilization form\" (mineral, i.e., calcium ammonium nitrate and urea vs organic, i.e., digestate) and III.)  \"soil types\" (Calcic Luvisol, Nudiargic Luvisol, and Calcaric Regosol) covering the typical range of erosion states in the hummocky ground moraine landscape of NE Germany. \nThis datasets contains weather data, NDVI/RVI measurements data , soil texture data, soil and plant analysis data, CO2 flux obtained using a novel robotic chamber system that were conducted from 23.07.2020 (after manipulation) - 29.06.2021 (Harvest).\n\nThis table contains the index of all tables forming this data collection.\n\nRelated datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.\nDataset version 1.0","id":"12f3a7bb-02da-4c99-b5bd-9803a0960263"}

{"text":"P adsorption was investigated on synthetic and commercially available goethite (99 %, Alfa Aesar). The composition and crystallinity was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analyses with an Empyrean powder diffractometer (PANalytical) with Cu K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.15418 nm). The determination of the d-values and the verification of the calculated lattice parameter were performed using the XPowder software. The specific surface area of 17.2 m2 g-1 was determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome) using a five-point BET measurement and N2. The point of zero charge (PZC) was determined using potentiometric titration by weighing 0.5 g of goethite into 50 ml PE-tubes and adding of 10 ml of a 0.02 M, 0.2 M, and 2 M KCl solution, respectively. The KCl solutions were diluted with ultrapure water to a total volume of 20 ml, leading to final concentrations of 0.01 M, 0.1 M, and 1 M, respectively. After closing the tubes, the samples were equilibrated for 4 days at 25\u00b0C to reach an equilibration pH value. Following, the suspension was titrated with 0.1 M KOH, and the pH was recorded after each addition of KOH as a function of the volume. A similar procedure was used for the blank solutions. The adsorbed amounts of H+ or OH- were calculated from the amount of KOH added to the samples minus the amount of KOH used by blank titration. The titration curves of the three different concentration steps intersect at the PZC, which was 8.8 for pure goethite without adsorbed P.\nP adsorption on goethite was studied in a batch setup at the pH values of 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12. Therefore, goethite sample material (5 g) for the respective pH steps was adjusted to pH 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12, respectively, in ultrapure water with 0.01 M HCl (pH 4), or 0.1 M to 5 M KOH (pH 6 to 12) using a Potentiometric Compact Titrator G20S and combined DGi115-SC pH electrode (Mettler-Toledeo) under continuous stirring. For P adsorption, 0.5 g of goethite and 40 ml of a 0.15 mmol l-1 KH2PO4, solution, adjusted to pH 4, 6, 8, 10, or 12 as well, were mixed to achieve a solid-solution ratio of 1:80. The goethite- KH2PO4 mixture was shaken horizontally at 150 motions min-1 for 24 h. The P concentration in the solution was determined after reaction times of 2, 24, 48, and 168 h. The samples have been centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 rpm and the clear supernatant was filtrated by using P-poor Whatmann 512 \u00bd filters. The concentrations of P and Fe were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). The adsorption experiments were done in duplicate.\nUnder real conditions in the soil, an influence of the P sorption on the pH is to be expected. Therefore, the pH change was taken into account both at the beginning and at the end of the adsorption experiments. The pH change was measured in a reference experiment that was treated exactly under the same conditions as P adsorption experiment. The amount of adsorbed P was referred to both the initial and the final pH.\nConsidering the initial pH, P adsorption on goethite was highest for pH 8, yielding a P surface coverage of 0.75 \u00b5mol m-2 after a reaction time of 168 h, followed by pH 6 with 0.72 \u00b5mol m-2, and pH 4 with 0.68 \u00b5mol m-2. The extent of adsorption decreased from pH 8 to 10 with 0.58 \u00b5mol m-2 and was lowest for pH 12 with 0.18 \u00b5mol m-2. The solution pH decreased for the initial pH 4 to 3.9., and for the initial pH of 6, the final pH was 5.0. For initial pH values 8.0 and 10.0, the corresponding final pH values were 6.7 and 7.6, respectively. At initial pH 12.0, the decrease of the solution pH weakened with a final pH of 11.6.\n\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences\n\nResearch question: How does the solution-pH affect the amount of adsorbed phosphorus on the goethite surface?","id":"142faafb-4e71-4b1e-b550-ca6864f5234b"}

{"text":"The base neutralizing capacity was determined according to Meiwes (1984) (see also Utermann et al., 2000). The method essentially consists of the addition of varying concentrations of a base to aliquots of the soil sample. The resulting pH changes are recorded along with the base concentration added.\n\nDespite of being a natural soil forming process, soil acidification is a major agronomic challenge under humid climate conditions as soil acidity influences several yield relevant soil properties. It can be counterbalanced by the regular application of agricultural lime to maintain or re-establish soil fertility and to optimize plant growth and yield. A direct method to determine the lime requirement (LR) of an agricultural soil is the base neutralizing capacity (BNC). It is a soil-base titrations that is defined as the amount of soil acidity that is neutralized by a base in a given time interval to a certain pH value. One advantage of the BNC-based LR is that it studies the effect of base addition on the pH individually for each soil sample. This is in contrast to the conventional indirect LR method applied in Germany that estimates the soil\u2019s LR based on empirical relationships derived in field experiments which does not further take into account (or measure) other factors affecting pH buffering such as clay mineralogy.\n\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences\n\nResearch question: Lime requirements of soils","id":"15c2b5c3-f224-49c0-94d8-4e1ed0d67eda"}

The area of research is the AgroScape Lab Quillow in the Uckermark in North-East Germany\nCoordinates of the stations can be found in the Supplemental material.\n\nMethods and obstacles\nFor the experiment six weather stations \u2018Davis vantage pro 2\u2019 were installed in the Quillow catchment area in the Uckermark. The six stations are located near the villages Dedelow, Rittgarten, Arendsee, Falkenhagen, Raakow and Kraatz (see supplemental data for exact coordinates).\nThe rain catcher was installed in a height of 1, 90 m, in order to avoid overgrowth and unwanted interferences by nearby plants. The anemometers were angled north. \nThe weather station in Dedelow was set up on the 03.05.2019. The five other stations were set up on the 28.06.2019. However, all calculations were conducted with the 01.07.2019 as starting point.\nThe data collected by the stations were gathered once every 7 weeks. In September 2020 however, there was a memory overflow issue, because of the corona pandemic the data were gathered two days after the station had reached its storage capacity of 53 days. Therefore, two days (12-13.08.2020) were missing for each station. \nFurthermore, the station 188 in Falkenhagen was having technical issues several times, leading to data gaps of several days and weeks.\nIn addition, the station in Dedelow does not collect the data consistently, probably due to transmissions issues, since the receiver is located inside a building which is approximately 30 m away from the station. The receivers of the other stations however are located inside a box which is attached directly to the station. \nAlso, the weather station 807 was hit by a tractor and hence was not in an upright position for an unknown period of time. This was discovered on the 19.12.2019. Therefore, the precipitation values of station 807 were replaced by the values of the closest station 275 in the period of 01.11.2019 \u2013 19.12.2019.

{"text":"Societal demands on soil functionality in agricultural soil-landscapes are confronted with yield losses and environmental impact. Soil functional information at national scale is required to address these challenges.

Each SFT is described by a multivariate soil parameter distribution along its depth profile. The agglomerated simplicity of the 3D multivariate soil parameter space into a limited number of spatially allocated process units provides the basis to run agricultural process models at national scale (Germany). \nThe data product refers to the parameter space until a depth of 1 m. It has a 100 m raster resolution in the 2D mapping space, and its resolution along the depth profile is 1 cm. It includes the soil properties: horizon occurrence probability of the organic horizon (symbol_H), the horizon with stagnic properties (symbol_S), groundwater influence (symbol G), and the C horizon (symbol_C), the depth limitation by bedrock (symbol_mC) as well as the soil properties texture (sand_content,  silt_content,  clay_content), stone content, and bulk density.\nThe data product consists of three files: A nationwide raster (SFT.tif) indicating the spatial allocation of the SFTs in terms of an identifier variable, and two related tables (MSPD1.csv and MSPD2.csv) including the information of the multivariate parameter distributions of the SFTs.

The soil samples were dried at 40 \u00b0C for five days and passed through a 2-mm sieve. Soil organic C and total N were determined using a CN analyzer (Elementar Vario El; Elementar Analysis Systems GmbH, Hanau, Germany); for soil samples with pH \u2265 6.0 pre-treatment for the removal of carbonates was performed (Harris et al. 2001). Soil pH was determined with a soil:water ratio of 1:4. The effective cation exchange capacity (ECEC) was determined as the sum of the cations determined by percolation of the soil with unbuffered 1 mol L-1 NH4Cl followed by analysis of the exchangeable cations (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Al, Fe, and Mn) in the percolate using an inductively coupled plasma-atomic spectrometer (ICP-AES; iCAP 6300 Duo VIEW ICP Spectrometer, Thermo Fischer Scientific GmbH, Dreieich, Germany).

{"text":"The European Commission Joint Research Centre performed a study that identifies factors affecting the fate of buried objects in soil and develops a method for assessing where preservation of different materials and stratigraphic evidence is more or less likely in the landscape. The results inform the extent of the cultural service that soil supports by preserving artefacts from and information about past societies. They are also relevant to predicting the state of existing and planned buried infrastructure and the persistence of materials spread on land. Soils are variable and preserve different materials and stratigraphic evidence differently. This study identifies the material and soil properties that affect preservation and relates these to soil types; it assesses their preservation capacities for bones, teeth and shells, organic materials, metals (Au, Ag, Cu, Fe, Pb and bronze), ceramics, glass and stratigraphic evidence. Preservation of Au, Pb and ceramics, glass and phytoliths is good in most soils but degradation rates of other materials (e.g. Fe and organic materials)\u00a0is strongly influenced by soil type. A method is proposed for using data on the distribution of soil types to map the variable preservation capacities of soil for different materials. This is applied at a continental scale across the EU for bones, teeth and shells, organic materials, metals (Cu, bronze and Fe) and stratigraphic evidence. The maps produced demonstrate how soil provides an extensive but variable preservation of buried objects.\n\u00a0\nThe results of the study have been published: \u00a0\"Predicting the preservation of cultural artefacts and buried materials in soil\", Mark Kibblewhite, Gergely T\u00f3th,Tam\u00e1s Hermann, Science of The Total Environment, Volume 529, 1 October 2015, Pages 249\u2013263.\n\u00a0\nThe 4 maps come as 1 shapefile with an attribute table that contains 4 fields corresponding to the 4 parameters mentioned above:\n\nbones, teeth and shells (bones)\norganic materials (organics)\nmetals (Cu, bronze and Fe) (metals)\nstratigraphic evidence (strati)\n\nThe values of the attrubutes vary between 1 and 3, as explained in the paper.\n\u00a0\nThe geometry of the shapefile is the one of the European Soil Database.

{"text":"Between 2017 and 2019 we studied the abundance of spider mites in the soil to estimate the potential infestation pressure of soil colonizing spider mites. The spider mites were heterogeneously distributed in small concentrations in the soil. Soil colonizing spider mites did not affect spider mite abundance on plants and reversed. We observed that spider mite migration occurred primarily from the edge of the field adjacent to the weed strip. In 2020 and 2021, we investigated the efficacy of the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) for suppressing spider mite hotspots in the cropland. We compared untreated spider mite hotspots with N. californicus treated hotspots and showed that a single release of predatory mites could result in a high level of control when spider mite infestation density was initially high. With this study, soil can be ruled out as a habitat for spider mites, and attention to spider mite pest control can be directed to plant infestations. The highly sensitive HRM real-time PCR assay was used for the quantification of the spider mites. Tetranychus urticae served as reference. Research domain: Soil Sciences Research question: Does the soil serve as a shelter for spider mites and must the soil be included in control strategies?

{"text":"The synthetic commercially hydroxides were goethite (99%, Alfa Aesar, Haverhill, Massachusetts, USA), and gibbsite (Merck Millipore, Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany), which were of analytical grade. 2-line-ferrihydrite was prepared, at which a 1 M KOH was added to 500 ml of a 0.2 M Fe(NO3)3 \u2219 9 H2O-solution, until a pH of 7.5 was reached. The developed precipitate was centrifuged and washed for 5 min at 12134 x G, subsequently frozen, freeze-dried, and stored in a desiccator. The mixed Fe-Al-hydroxides were prepared by mixing 0.1 M Fe(NO3)3 \u2219 9 H2O and 0,1 M Al(NO3)3 \u2219 9 H2O were mixed in molar ratios of 1:0, 10:1, 5:1. 1:1, 1:5, 1:10 and 0:1, and brought to a pH of 6 with 5 M KOH. After equilibration for 1 h, the precipitate was centrifuged for 5 min at 12134 x G, washed with ultrapure water, dried at 60\u00b0C, and ground into a powder.\nThe elemental composition of the adsorbents was verified using SEM-EDX, scanning electron microscopy (DSM 962, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (X-Max 50 mm\u00b2 with INCA, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, Great Britain). The final resulting mineral phase of pure Al(OH)3 and FeO(OH) for the amorphous hydroxides was identified. Determination of the minerals crystallization as well as amorphous structures were verified by X-ray diffraction (XRD), using an Empyrean powder diffractometer (PANalytical, Almelo, Netherlands), with a theta-theta-goniometer, Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.15418 nm), automatic divergent and anti-scatter slits and a PIXcel3D detector. Diffraction data were recorded from 4.6\u00b0 to 84.9\u00b0 2\u03f4 with a step-size of 0.0131, a step time of 58.4 s, and generator settings of 40 kV and 40 mA.\nPrior to desorption, the hydroxides were coated on silica sand (particle size 0.2 \u2013 0.8 mm, Merck Millipore) to ensure a similar sample treatment (e.g. centrifugation times and revolutions). The silica sand used was finely granulated, washed, and calcined. 10 g of the hydroxide in a 0.01 M NaNO3-solution were adjusted to pH 6, resulting in a final volume of 100 ml. 100 g of pure silica sand was added to the suspension, and shaken for 24 h at room temperature. The supernatant was decanted and the material was washed three to five times with the 0.01 M NaNO3-solution at pH 6, and in a final step with ultrapure water to remove hydroxide traces and soluble salts. The coated silica sand was oven dried at 60\u00b0C for 48 h. The silica-hydroxide mixtures were preload with P. Therefore, 200 ml of a 2 mmol l-1 KH2PO4 solution and a 0.01 M CaCl2 background solution were added to the mixtures. After shaking horizontally for 24 h at 150 motions min-1, the hydroxides were centrifuged for 5 min at 929 x G. The supernatant was filtrated and the adsorbed P concentration determined\nDesorption experiments were conducted with CaCl2, CaSO4, humic acid, and citric acid, adjusted to pH 6. 2.5 g of the coated silica sand was treated with 50 ml of 0.01 M CaCl2 or 0.01 M CaSO4. 5 g of the coated silica sand was used for desorption with 50 ml of 2 g l-1 humic acid and citric acid (Alfa Aesar). A concentration of 2 g l-1 for both humic and citric acid was selected to provide a concentration similar to that of the CaCl2 and CaSO4. For desorption experiments, treatment solutions were added to the samples, shaken at 150 motions min-1, and centrifuged for 15 min at 2091 x g.

Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents.

{"text":"Incorporation of flower strips is an agricultural measure to increase aboveground biodiversity and ecosystem services. Although soil communities are key components of terrestrial biodiversity and drive important ecosystem services, their abundance, diversity, and composition in flower strips remain largely unexplored. Here, we shed light on earthworms in flower strips. We sowed a field margin vegetation as well as two annual and two perennial flower strip mixtures in fully randomized plots of 9\u00d728 m in three different types of soil in Germany. Two years following sowing, we determined earthworm communities using chemical extraction. Different plant mixtures (i.e. field margin, annual and perennial flower strip mixtures) harbored distinct earthworm communities. Earthworm density and biomass declined or remained unaffected in annual flower strips but increased in perennial flower strips as compared to the field margin vegetation. We attribute changes in earthworm communities mainly to the effect of tillage and plant diversity.\n\nResearch domain: Ecology of Agricultural Landscapes\n\nResearch question: None","id":"273ccac4-8857-4f59-a10d-bfb73561a78b"}
{"text":"Phosphorus (P) fertilizers and mycorrhiza formation can both significantly improve the P supply of plants, but P fertilizers might inhibit mycorrhiza formation and change the microbial P cycling. To test the dimension and consequences of P fertilizer impacts under maize (Zea mays L.), three fertilizer treatments (1) triple superphosphate (TSP, 21\u201330 kg P ha\u20131 annually), biowaste compost (ORG, 30 Mg ha\u20131 wet weight every third year) and a combination of both (OMI) were compared to a non-P-fertilized control (C) in 2015 and 2016. The test site was a long-term field experiment on a Stagnic Cambisol in Rostock (NE Germany). Soil microbial biomass P (Pmic) and soil enzyme activities involved in P mobilization (phosphatases and \u00df-glucosidase), plant available P content (double lactate-extract; PDL), mycorrhizal colonization, shoot biomass, and shoot P concentrations were determined. P deficiency led to decreased P immobilization in microbial biomass, but the maize growth was not affected. TSP application alone promoted the P uptake by the microbial biomass but reduced the mycorrhizal colonization of maize compared to the control by more than one third. Biowaste compost increased soil enzyme activities in the P cycling, increased Pmic and slightly decreased the mycorrhizal colonization of maize. Addition of TSP to biowaste compost increased the content of PDL in soil to the level of optimal plant supply. Single TSP supply decreased the ratio of PDL:Pmic to 1:1 from about 4:1 in the control. Decreased plant-benefits from mycorrhizal symbiosis were assumed from decreased mycorrhizal colonization of maize with TSP supply. The undesirable side effects of TSP supply on the microbial P cycling can be alleviated by the use of compost. Thus, it can be concluded that the plant-availability of P from soil amendments is controlled by the amendment-specific microbial P cycling and, likely, P transfer to plants. Peine et al.

The objective was to identify grain legume species and cultivars for designing novel cropping systems in north-eastern Germany. The data supports agronomic analyses, as well as dynamic simulation modelling and includes details on crop growth, soil characteristics and weather. In the first part of the experiment different species and cultivars and the effect of irrigation were compared in a split block design with four replicates and the factors species/cultivar and irrigation during five consecutive years (2017-2021). The treatments included eight to 18 species/cultivars depending on the year with soybean, narrow-leafed lupin, white lupin, yellow lupin, faba bean and chickpea. Buckwheat was cultivated as a reference crop. Soybean and lupin seeds were inoculated with HISTICK\u00ae soybean/lupin (BASF, Germany). No fertilizers and conventional crop protection was applied. All lupin species were treated with a natural insecticide against the Sitona weevils. For technical reasons, treatment with this insecticide of field bean, soybean and buckwheat was also unavoidable in some years. Measurements included grain yield, one thousand seed weigh, macro nutrients (N, P, K) in the grain, and additional agronomic observations including number of plants and plant phenology. Irrigation water was applied with a sprinkler system using the Web-BEREST model (Mirschel et al., 2014) to determine the amounts and timing (data on the amounts and dates are provided).

The initial P-concentrations for the adsorption experiments were 150 \u00b5mol l-1, 1000 \u00b5mol l-1 and 2000 \u00b5mol l-1  KH2PO4 for gibbsite and 1000 \u00b5mol l-1, 2000 \u00b5mol l-1 and 5000 \u00b5mol l-1 KH2PO4 for ferrihydrite and the Fe:Al-hydroxides with a 0.01 mol l-1 CaCl2-background electrolyte solution, adjusted to a pH of 6. For P measurements, the gibbsite and ferrihydrite samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 336 \u00d7 G, while the Fe:Al-hydroxide samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 21572 \u00d7 G. The clear supernatant was filtered by using P-poor Whatman 512 1/1 filters.\nThe elemental composition of the adsorbents was verified by using SEM-EDX, scanning electron microscopy (DSM 962, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (X-Max 50 mm\u00b2 with INCA, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, Great Britain). The formation of pure Al(OH)3 and FeO(OH) for the amorphous hydroxides was revealed. Determination of the adsorbent crystallization as well as amorphous structures was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical Empyrean powder diffractometer (Almelo, Netherlands) from GFZ Potsdam, with a theta-theta-goniometer, Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.15418 nm), automatic divergent and anti-scatter slits and a PIXcel3D detector.

{"text":"A central aspect when including catch crops into a crop rotation is the conservation of nutrients in their biomass for the subsequently grown crop. However, the nutrient carry-over to the following crop depends not only on the amount of nutrients accumulated in individual catch crop plant materials but also on the specific degradation properties of their tissues, i.e. the temporal quantitative and qualitative release of scavenged nutrients. In our experiment we investigated the morphological and nutritional response of maize to 6 different pre-grown catch crop variants including pure stands and mixtures. \nAt two field sites in Germany (Asendorf - Lower Saxony and Triesdorf - Bavaria), maize (seeding rate: 9.4 seeds m-2) was established either after pure cultures of mustard, phacelia, bristle oat and Egyptian clover, after a mixture of these 4 species or after a commercial mixture of the DSV with a higher species diversity called TerraLife MaisPro. Their single-species nutrient accumulation was already published in the BonaRes-database under \u201cCatch crop nutrient uptake 1st crop rotation cycle\u201d.  Fallow plots were included as control. Maize was fertilized with 160 kg N ha-1 in Asendorf and 190 kg N ha-1 in Triesdorf. Since nutrient release from catch cops might temporarily vary, we studied the morphological and nutritional response of maize at 4 developmental stages ranging from leaf development over shoot elongation and flowering to cob development. As morphological parameters we investigated the number of leaves, tillers and cobs. In order to study the nutritional response we examined the shoot biomass, chlorophyll content or SPAD values and different nutrient concentrations in young and old leaves as well as the nitrate concentration in the press sap obtained from a 1 cm-piece of the stem base as marker for the nitrogen nutritional status. At both locations, the experiment was repeated in two subsequent years (2016 and 2017) and represented each the initial starting point of a wheat-catch crop-maize long-term rotation. Thus, maize response was tested in total in 4 environments. \nIn general we could not observe any significant impact of the pre-grown catch crop variant on morphological or nutritional shoot parameters at any of the investigated developmental stages and in none of the test environments. However, catch crop effects often develop in the long run when included regularly in a crop rotation.","id":"2dcc638c-6eca-4f91-a860-8ccd5cf3a2ef"}

{"text":"The bone char used for P release experiments was produced by Bonechar Carv\u00e3o Ativado Do Brasil Ltda. (Maring\u00e1, Brazil) in 2015. It has been manufactured by pyrolysis of rendered (de-fatted) bovine bones at more than 800\u00b0C. A particle size analysis of the bone char was carried out, whereby 100 g of char was divided into three particle size fractions:  200 \u00b5m, 200 - 2000 \u00b5m, and 2000 \u00b5m. The P bearing minerals used were the commercially available Ca-phosphate hydroxyapatite (Ca5[OH(PO4)3]) (Acros Organics, Geel, Belgium) and the Fe-phosphate vivianite (Fe32+[PO4]2 \u00b7 8H2O). Vivianite was prepared where 250 ml of a 0.035 M H3PO4-solution were added to solid FeSO4. The resulting 0.05 M FeSO4-solution was adjusted to pH 6 with 5 M KOH. The precipitate formed was centrifuged for 5 min at 2090 \u00d7 G and washed with ultrapure water. The prepared vivianite was dried at 40\u00b0C and ground into powder using mortar and pestle. P, Ca, and Fe were determined using ICP-AES after pressure digestion or aqua regia digestion.\nThe composition of hydroxyapatite and vivianite was verified using X-ray diffraction (XRD). The specific surface area was determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome, Odelzhausen, Germany) using a multi-point BET-measurement (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) and N2 as adsorptive medium. The specific surface area of hydroxyapatite was with 68.4 m\u00b2 g-1 1.7 fold higher than for vivianite with 39.5 m\u00b2 g-1. Bone char had the highest specific surface area with values in the range from 92.1 to 94.8 m\u00b2 g-1, increasing with decreasing particle size.\nP release experiments were conducted in triplicate by using a batch setup with an initial pH of 6. For this, 2.5 g of the bone char and the phosphate minerals were weighed into PE bottles. Batch solubilization experiments were performed with CaCl2 (Merck Millipore) and citric acid with the formula C6H8O7 (99 %, Alfa Aesar), adjusted to pH 6 with KOH. These reaction solutions were used in concentrations 0.01 M, 0.05 M, and 0.1 M, respectively. 50 ml reaction solution was added to the bone char samples and 40 ml was added to hydroxyapatite and vivianite samples, respectively. The samples were shaken on a horizontal shaker for 24 h at 200 motions min-1, centrifuged for 15 min at 2090 \u00d7 G, and the supernatant was filtrated by using P-poor Whatman 512 1/2 filters. Following, fresh reaction solution was added to the samples. Samples for P measurement were taken after 2, 6, 24, 48, and 168 h.\nThe cumulative P release based on 168 h with CaCl2 is very low for all used materials. While the total P release for bone char was close to the detection limit, minor P concentrations were measured for vivianite and hydroxyapatite, which increased slightly with increasing CaCl2 concentration. The use of citric acid enabled significantly more P to be solved, whereby an increase of dissolved P with increasing citric acid concentration was measured as well.

{"text":"Ground-based NDVI sensors are vital for an accurate, localized crop condition and growth assessment, but their high cost and labor-intensive nature limit accessibility. Here, we present a low-cost NDVI sensor device, priced under 250 Euros, which can be utilized both manually as a handheld tool and automatically as a standalone device to address this issue. We calibrated and field validated the low-cost NDVI sensor against a commercial sensor for ground-based NDVI measurements. Our calibration revealed a slight underestimation at higher NDVI values measured from the low-cost sensor, which we adjusted using a correction function. Field validation proved the accuracy of low-cost sensor device, with a high correlation (r\u00b2 = 0.99; y = 1.04x + 0.003) and good agreement with the reference device, after applying then derived correction function. Further field trial application of the low-cost sensor as a handheld device (manual mode) in Benin and the Philippines for rice and pineapple cultivation, respectively, demonstrated the reliability of the device to monitor crop development and biomass accumulation. An additional field testing in an oat field site in Germany showed that the developed low-cost NDVI sensor, functioning as a standalone automatic device, is robust, reliable and capable to monitor crop development during senescence, through higher temporal resolution NDVI measurements.

{"text":"We investigate the impacts of increasing plant diversity in catch crop rotations on rhizosphere C input and microbial utilization. Mustard (Sinapis alba L.) planted as a single cultivar was compared to diversified catch crop mixtures of four (Mix4) or 12 species (Mix12). We traced the C transfer from shoots to roots towards the soil microbial community and the soil respiration in a 13C pulse labelling field experiment. The data set included measurements of organic carbon, total nitrogen as well as their stable isotopes in plant and soil material.  The growth and activity of the soil microbiome was investigated by phospholipid fatty acid (PLFA) analyses. The transferred of C from plants towards the microbiome was measured by 13C label concentration in specific PLFA markers.\n\nMore information is available: Gentsch, N., Boy, J., Batalla, J.D.K. et al.

More specifically, the efficiency for C uptake and the belowground input of recently photosynthesized C products and their partitioning in the rhizosphere was investigated. We hypothesized that diversified catch cropping systems would (I) increase photosynthetic C fixation with higher transport rates of newly assimilated C to the roots, (II) stimulate microbial growth through higher C utilization when C reaches the rhizosphere and (III) prolongate the C cycling throughout the plant-soil-microbiome system.","id":"3139a989-68de-4b85-a786-5c2fd2f0b069"}

{"text":"The mobilization of P and its compounds in arable soils is largely affected by groundwater fluctuations, the amount of precipitation and the associate changes in redox potential (EH) as well as the redox-induced changes of biogeochemical processes. However, those processes are still not fully understood. Thus, we aimed 1) to study the redox induced-release of phosphorus (P) in different arable soil horizons as affected by their properties and the redox potential (EH)-dependent changes on governing factors such as soil pH, Al, Fe, Mn, Ca, and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), and 2) to examine the impact of addition of carbon sources (rice straw + glucose) on the soil EH/pH changes and on the relevant changes on mobilization of phosphorus in the different soils. We collected top, subsurface, and subsoil horizons from three different soil profiles representing different arable soils originating from Germany, treated the soils with straw + glucose, flooded the treated and untreated soils in triplicates and incubated them for 432 hours. Soil EH, pH, and salinity were measured and soil slurry was collected from all treatments after different incubation times (e., 15 minutes to 432 hours) and analyzed for total dissolved P, PO43-, SO42-, Fe, Al, Fe, Mn, Ca, DIC, and further anions concentrations. Results showed that application of straw and glucose changed significantly soil EH, pH, and total dissolved P content as compared to the untreated soils. Soil EH varied from +194 to +310 mV in the untreated soil and from -520 to +230 mV in the treated soils. Soil pH varied from 6.6 to 7.9 in the untreated soil and from 4.2 to 7.7 in the treated soils. Total dissolved P varied from 0.04 to 0.70 mg/l in the untreated soil and from 0.05 to 10.5 mg/l in the treated soils. Straw + glucose-treated soils exhibited a wider range of EH, a lower pH, and a higher dissolved P content than the un-treated soils. The pH of the treated soils decreased significantly with decreasing soil EH. Total dissolved P in the top soils increased significantly under reducing acidic conditions as compared to the oxidizing alkaline conditions. Our results suggest that the release of P in acidic arable soils rich in organic carbon should be of concern from both agricultural and environmental points of view.","id":"31268e17-675c-4698-b64c-1b257a2ad6e8"}

{"text":"The study focuses on the impact of a beneficial microbial consortium on the plant performance of winter rye under different farming practices during the vegetation period, including the winter growing season. Winter rye plants grown in a long-time field trial (Thy_ABS; 52\u00b015\u2019 N, 13\u00b014\u2019 E, 44 m a.s.l.)  under conventional or organic farming practices were inoculated after plant emergence in autumn 2020 with a beneficial microbial consortium containing Pseudomonas sp. (RU47, drench inoculation with 2 L per m\u00b2 of 7.5 x 107 CFU mL-1), Bacillus atrophaeus (ABi03, drench inoculation with 2 L per m\u00b2 of 7.5 x 107 CFU mL-1) and Trichoderma harzianum (OMG16, soil inoculation with 100 mg inoculum per m\u00b2). The density of the microbial inoculants in the rhizosphere and root-associated soil as well as the plant performance and nutrient status was quantified in autumn and the following spring. Selective plating demonstrated that the beneficial microbes successfully colonized the rhizosphere and root-associated soil of winter rye throughout its early growth cycle. The inoculation with a beneficial microbial consortium enhanced the biomass of winter rye, especially under organic farming practices at the second sampling in spring. The consortium significantly improved the nutrient status of the winter rye plants, providing an effective way to overcome nutrient limitations often found in organic farming.\n\nResearch domain: Plant Cultivation and Agricultural Technology\n\nResearch question: We hypothesized that (i) early inoculation of winter rye enables sufficient colonization of each BMc member at\nearly plant developmental stage, supporting its persistence in the rhizosphere throughout the vegetation period; (ii) the application of BMc shapes the composition of the rhizosphere bacterial community depending on the farming practice and thus differentially affects the plant performance.","id":"31463cb6-8ba6-4e6d-be32-2de9059c85bc"}
{"text":"Soil erosion affects 20% of croplands. However, our understanding of the effect that soil erosion might have on emissions of N2O, which is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, is still limited. This limitation is likely because the small-scale differences in soil properties and fertility induced by erosion (i.e. ranges of erosion states) have barely been considered in studies quantifying N2O emissions from croplands. There are, however, indications that the erosion state itself strongly impacts N2O fluxes, similar to the N fertilizer form. Therefore, our investigations aimed to further explore these indications. The soil and erosion stages of the study area are classified as Albic Luvisols (LVa; non-eroded dry soil), Calcaric Regosol (RGca; extremely eroded dry soil) and Endogleyic Colluvic Regosols (RGco; wet colluvial soil in a depression). \n\n\nThis datasets contains data of soil data, N2O flux obtained from the measurements that were conducted from 03/05/2010 to 03/05/2013 within the hummocky ground moraine landscape of northeastern Germany (CarboZALF-D), modelled N2O flux and Nmin data.

{"text":"This dataset is provided by the SIGNAL subproject \u201cMacrofauna diversity and pest control in temperate agroforestry systems\u201d and contains spider count data from emergence traps of five cropland alley-cropping sites in Northern Germany. Each site comprised a paired alley-cropping agroforestry system (AF) and an adjacent open cropland system (OC) serving as a reference land-use system without trees. At each agroforestry system, four subplots were arranged along linear transects orthogonal to the orientation of the tree rows, with a sampling point at the center of the tree row and at 1, 7, and 24 m (center of the crop row) distance from the tree row edge into the crop row. Open cropland systems had 4 subplots (sampling point) with a minimum distance of 25 m between each other and at least 30 m to the field margins. In total, 20 emergence traps (16 agroforestry, 4 open cropland) were set up at each site. Emergence traps consisted of a white gauze tent covering an area of 0.36 m2 (60 x 60 cm; height: 60 cm) with sides buried 10 cm deep to ensure no exchange between inside and outside. Inside the tents, a pitfall trap (95mm opening diameter, 639 ml volume) and a bottle at the top of the tent were filled with a 50/50 mixture of propylene glycol and water to catch arthropods.

{"text":"In this study, we assessed the influence of above- and belowground diversity, as well as urbanization and plant invasions, on multifunctionality and organic carbon stocks of soils in non-manipulated grasslands along an urbanization gradient in Berlin, Germany. We focused on plant diversity (measured as species richness and functional trait diversity) and, in addition, on soil organism diversity as a potential mediator for the relationship of plant species diversity and ecosystem functioning. Our results showed positive effects of plant diversity on soil multifunctionality and soil organic carbon stocks along the entire gradient. Structural equation models revealed that plant diversity enhanced soil multifunctionality and soil organic carbon by increasing the diversity of belowground organisms. These positive effects of plant diversity on soil multifunctionality and soil fauna were not restricted to native plant species only, but were also exerted by non-native species, although to a lesser degree. We conclude that enhancing diversity in plants and soil fauna of urban grasslands can increase the multifunctionality of urban soils and also add to their often underestimated but very valuable role in mitigating effects of climate change.","id":"3d41c738-2e57-4c9e-b81f-3a1cd7722f30"}

Changes in soil organic carbon (SOC) stocks are among these sources and sinks. Furthermore, soil organic matter is a key indicator of soil fertility. The Th\u00fcnen Institute of Climate-Smart Agriculture was commissioned by the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture to conduct the first German agricultural soil inventory and obtain a first representative and consistent baseline of SOC stocks in agricultural soils across Germany. Potential explanatory variables were also assessed. Between 2009 and 2018, a total of 3104 field sites were sampled in a 8x8 km grid (Jacobs et al., 2018). The dataset contains the key data (laboratory and field) of the first German agricultural soil inventory.

In each pot 280 mg of P were added into 6 kg (DM) of an acidic (pH 5.2) sandy silt soil with initially low amounts of available P (24.2 mg kg-1 PCAL). Zero and TSP fertilisation served as control in the completely randomized block experiment with four replicates. An incubation period of between 0 days and 8 weeks in fortnightly steps was implemented. The P uptake of annual rye grass was only slightly influenced by the incubation time of the fertilisers in soil. The relative agronomic efficiency (RAE) shows that MAP performed equally or better than TSP (RAE = 100 %). BCplus had an average RAE of 87 %, with a high variation between the incubation times. The RAE of SSA seemed to decrease constantly with incubation time. SSA, BCplus and MAP seemed all to perform best when applied directly prior to seeding.","id":"4814a13a-92ad-469e-8051-88b8c57328e7"}

{"text":"Scaling with ranked subsampling (SRS) is an algorithm for the normalization of species count data in ecology. So far, SRS has successfully been applied to microbial community data.\n\"SRS is now available on CRAN: https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=SRS\" \nAn implementation of SRS in R is available for download: https://metadata.bonares.de/smartEditor/rest/upload/ID_7049_2020_05_13_SRS_function_v1_0_R.zip\n\nSRS consists of two steps. In the first step, the counts for all OTUs (operational taxonomic untis) are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts (Cscaled with integer or non-integer values) equals Cmin. In the second step, the non-integer count values are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling. The scaled count Cscaled for each OTU is split into the integer-part Cint by truncating the digits after the decimal separator (Cint = floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cint). Since \u03a3Cint \u2264 Cmin, additional \u2206C = Cmin - \u03a3Cint counts have to be added to the library to reach the total count of Cmin. This is achieved as follows. OTUs are ranked in the descending order of their Cfrac values. Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added counts reaches \u2206C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library equals Cmin. When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking \u2206C counts is shared by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are selected in the order of their Cint values. This selection minimizes the effect of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs. OTUs with identical Cfrag as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement.","id":"4b2b65c6-ff50-4669-99cc-ace343de3548"}

{"text":"The soil fungal community was surveyed across a 52-year chronosequence of soil recultivation after open-mining, during two seasons (March-winter, July-summer). The study sites correspond to agricultural fields located within an area of 25 km 2 (6\u00b015\u20190\u2019 E to 6\u00b021\u20190\u2019 E and 50\u00b050\u20195\u2019 N to 50\u00b053\u20190\u2019 N) of an open-cast lignite mine at Inden, between Cologne, Aachen, M\u00f6nchengladbach, and D\u00fcsseldorf. The soil extraction, deposition and recultivation process leads to a chronosequence of fields recultivated from less than one year to fields recultivated for 52 years, at samling time of 2016. During the first three years, fields are permanently covered by alfalfa and never receive artificial fertilisers or biocide treatments (fields recultivated since 2016, 2015, 2014 and 2013, referred to as phase 1). In the following two years, agricultural practises are resumed with barley cropping by RWE Power AG, and a N:P:K (1:0.4:0.6) fertilisation of 437 kg ha\u22121 a\u22121 (fields recultivated since 2012 and 2011 referred to as phase 2). Afterwards, fields are returned to farmers and conventionally managed with a crop sequence of winter wheat after sugar beet, one tillage a year to 30 cm depth, and a continuous management practice following area-typical agricultural practice and plant-protection guidelines (fields recultivated since 2006, 1990, 1979, 1971 and 1964, referred to as phase 3). Other agricultural fields that have not yet been subject to extraction were sampled too (referred to as pre-mining phase). They are a total of 115 samples (5 replicates per field x 2 seasons, each field corresponds to a year of recultivation). Four samples were removed due to failed PCR. The soil fungal community was analyzed with 300 bp paired-end Illumina MiSeq sequencing of ITS2 sequences (primers fITS7: 5\u2032\u2010GTGARTCATCGAATCTTTG\u20103\u2032 / ITS4: 5\u2032\u2010TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC\u20103\u2032). Amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) were inferred using DADA2 in R. Taxonomic annotations were performed using the IDTaxa algorithm implemented in the DECIPHER R package, against UNITE (version of 10.05.2021). Raw sequencing reads are available at ENA under study project PRJEB51095. The DNA sequences of the fungal amplicon sequence variants are available at ENA under accession numbers OV986018-OV989728. The processed dataset including the ASV count table, ASV taxonomy, and sample metadata compiled as a phyloseq R object stored in a single .RDS R file, as well as ASV guild annotation using Funguild database, are available at figshare at (https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.20160578).

{"text":"In recent years, agricultural machinery became steadily larger and heavier. Especially under wet soil conditions, when soil is susceptible to compaction, heavy wheel load field traffic can lead to harmful soil compaction. This data set contains soil data from a wheeling experiment with agricultural vehicles from the silage maize harvest chain (maize chopper (total weight: ~20 t), tractor with mulcher (total weight: ~12 t), and tractor with silage trailer (total weight: ~32 t)). The experiment was conducted in 2017 on an agricultural test field in Adenstedt (Hildesheim district, Lower Saxony, Germany). The soil type is Stagnic Luvisol derived from Loess and was tilled with a cultivator up to a depth of 25 cm (reduced tillage). For the wheeling experiment, the harvest chain vehicles passed defined plots in the inner field area one after another (8 wheel passes). Maximum soil pressure und plastic soil deformation evoked by vehicle passing was measured simultaneously with a multi-channel device consisting of Bolling probes (Bolling, 1987) and hydrostatic measuring hoses (Nolting et al., 2006). Maximum soil pressure and plastic soil deformation was measured in 20, 35, and 50 cm depth directly below the center of the tires. To investigate changes in soil physical parameters, soil structure, and soil functions caused by harvest chain vehicles driving, undisturbed soil cores (100 cm\u00b3) were taken before (unwheeled) and after wheeling (wheeled). The sampling sites were located in the inner field area. Two soil pits were sampled per wheeling variant. A total of 30 undisturbed soil samples were taken per each soil pit, 10 per each soil depth (20, 35, 50 cm). The soil biopores were counted in every one of the three soil depths. 5 of the 10 undisturbed sampling rings were used to investigate soil water retention and the other 5 for saturated hydraulic conductivity. The determination of pF values was conducted in the soil laboratory using sand and clay boxes as well as pressure pots according to DIN ISO 11274. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was analyzed using a soil water permeameter (open system) according to ISO / FDIS 17312. The soil parameters total pore volume, air capacity, field capacity, usable field capacity, permanent wilting point, dry bulk density, and current water content during soil sampling were derived from the soil laboratory results.","id":"540f1b97-ef14-4f0f-93f6-c2d94f31c94b"}

This data collection consists of 26 individual tables which are related to each other. General description: In organic farms under low yielding site conditions (e.g. sandy soils, dry climate) the size of animal husbandry is frequently restricted by the fact that the site conditions allow for a limited quantity of forage growing only. Some of those farms are even stockless farms. The positive effects of farmyard manure can poorly or not at all be used. Plant based organic fertilizer, e.g. legume biomass or pulse meal, can be an alternative, however, their effects on crop yield and quality and on soil organic matter development has to be carefully studied. This was the objective of the second long-term trial \u201cField E\u201d in Darmstadt, Germany.\nThe experiment was set up in 1996, using a randomized block design with six replicates and 5\u00d75 m experimental plots. A 5 m strip was left between the blocks, which was cropped identically to the experimental plot but remained unfertilized. \nThe experiment consisted of seven treatments: (i) inorganic fertilizers, (ii) plant based organic fertilizer, (iii) plant based organic fertilizer with addition of biodynamic preparations, (iv) cattle farmyard manure, (v) cattle farmyard manure with addition of biodynamic preparations, (vi) high level of cattle farmyard manure, and (vii) high level of cattle farmyard manure with biodynamic preparations.\nFurther details are given by Heinze et al.

{"text":"Heterogenous flow pathways through the soil are a major component in the transport of water, dissolved and particle-bound nutrients like phosphorus (P) to water resources, and promote the eutrophication of water bodies. Non-uniform water flow patterns may also influence the spatial variability of the P-content in soils. \nThis study was designed to understand the spatial distribution of P in agriculturally used soils and the mechanism causing P accumulation and depletion at the centimeter scale. We conducted three replicate dye tracer experiments using Brilliant Blue on a loamy Stagnosol in North-Eastern-Germany. The plant-available phosphorus of stained and unstained areas was analyzed using double lactate extraction (DL-P) and diffusive gradients on thin films (DGT-P). \nThe DL-P and the DGT-P were strongly correlated (p0.001, R\u00b2=0.63) confirming that DL-P is a good measure for the mobile phase of soil P. \nThe plant available P contents of the topsoil were significantly higher than those of the subsoil in all three replicates. The topsoil\u2019s stained areas showed higher P contents than unstained areas, while the opposite was found for the subsoil. The P contents varied strongly over the soil profiles (0.4 to 11.2 mg P 100 g-1) and different categories of flow patterns (matrix flow, flow fingers, preferential flow and no flow). The P contents of these flow patterns differed significantly from each other and followed the order: Pmatrix flow  Pfinger flow  Pno flow  Ppreferential flow.","id":"54ecbb64-7cc4-46d2-957d-d37e957daf98"}

{"text":"Acceptability of novel bone char fertilizers depends on their P release but reactions at bone char surfaces and impacts to soil P speciation are insufficiently known. By sequential fractionation and synchrotron-based X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy we investigated whether and how the chemical composition of bone char particles has been altered in soil and, consequently, has affected the P speciation of amended soils. Therefore, two different kinds of bone char particles (BC, produced by pyrolysis of degreased animal bone chips at 800 \u00baC and BCplus, a BC enriched with reduced sulfur compounds) were manually separated from the soil at the end of two different experiments: \u201cincubation-leaching\u201d and \u201cryegrass cultivation\u201d. Sequential P-fractionation of amended soils showed P-enrichment in all fractions as compared to the control. The most P increase between all treatments significantly occurred in the NaOH-P and resin-P fractions in response to BCplus application in both, incubation-leaching and ryegrass cultivation experiments. This increase of the readily available P fraction in BCplus treated soils was confirmed by linear combination fitting (LCF) analysis on P K-edge XANES spectra of BCs particles and amended soils. The proportion of Ca-hydroxyapatite decreased, whereas the proportion of CaHPO4 increased in BCplus particles after amended soils had been incubated and leached and cropped by ryegrass. Based on P-XANES speciation as determined by LCF analysis, the proportion of inorganic Ca(H2PO4)2 increased in amended soils after BCplus application. These results indicated that soil amendment with BCplus particles leads to elevated P concentration and maintains more soluble P species than BC particles even after 230-days of ryegrass cultivation.

There are several studies in the literature with the aim of finding the best method to assess and map the distribution of SOC content for Europe. This study aims to search for the effects and performances of using aggregated soil samples coming from different studies and land-uses.\nThe total number of the soil samples in this study was 23,835 and they were collected from the \u201cLand Use/Cover Area frame Statistical Survey\u201d (LUCAS) Project (samples from agricultural soil), the BioSoil Project (samples from forest soil), and the \u201cSoil Transformations in European Catchments\u201d (SoilTrEC) Project (samples from local soil data coming from five different critical zone observatories (CZOs) in Europe). Moreover, 15 spatial indicators (slope, aspect, elevation, compound topographic index (CTI), CORINE land-cover classification, parent material, texture, world reference base (WRB) soil classification, geological formations, annual average temperature, min-max temperature, total precipitation and average precipitation (for the years 1960\u20131990 and 2000\u20132010)) were used as auxiliary variables in this prediction. One of the most popular geostatistical techniques, Regression-Kriging (RK), was applied to build the model and assess the distribution of SOC.\nThis study showed that, even though the RK method was appropriate for successful SOC mapping, using combined databases did not increase the statistical significance of the method results for assessing the SOC distribution as much as expected. Combining local data coming from CZOs with LUCAS samples was found as more significant than combining the two big datasets of the LUCAS and Biosoil Projects. Moreover, the effect of the chosen auxiliary variables on SOC prediction seems more important than increasing the number of the soil samples. According to the results: SOC variation was mainly affected by elevation, slope, CTI, average temperature, average and total precipitation, texture, WRB and CORINE variables at the European scale in the model. Moreover, the highest average SOC contents were found in the wetland areas; agricultural areas have much lower SOC content than forest and semi natural areas; Ireland, Sweden and Finland show the highest SOC values; Portugal, Poland, Hungary, Spain and Italy show the lowest values with an average 3%.\n\u00a0\nData (available: 3 output datasets and 1 input dataset):\n0. \u00a0 \u00a0 Input: soil sample point data; attribute: SOC for each point.\n1. \u00a0 \u00a0 Predicted distribution of SOC content by using 1 dataset (LUCAS) (Figure 3 in the article)\n2.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Predicted distribution of SOC content by using 2 datasets (LUCAS-CZOs) (Figure 4 in the article)\n3.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Predicted distribution of SOC content by using 3 datasets (LUCAS-CZOs-BIOSOIL) (Figure 5 in the article)\n\u00a0\nAcknowledgments\nFunding support is acknowledged from the European Commission FP 7 Collaborative Project \u201cSoil Transformations in European Catchments\u201d (SoilTrEC) (Grant Agreement no. 244118).","id":"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu//content/predicted-distribution-soc-content-europe-based-lucas-biosoil-and-czo-context-eu-funded-1"}

{"text":"We present a comprehensive, high-quality dataset characterising soil-vegetation and land-surface processes from continuous measurements conducted in two climatically contrasting study regions in South West Germany: the warmer and drier Kraichgau region with a mean temperature of 9.7\u00b0C and annual precipitation of 890 mm, and the cooler and wetter Swabian. Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content.

{"text":"We present a comprehensive, high-quality dataset characterising soil-vegetation and land-surface processes from continuous measurements conducted in two climatically contrasting study regions in South West Germany: the warmer and drier Kraichgau region with a mean temperature of 9.7\u00b0C and annual precipitation of 890 mm, and the cooler and wetter Swabian. Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes.

{"text":"Within the EIP-AGRI-funded project \u201cpH-BB: Precision liming in Brandenburg\u201d, research was conducted on improving the management of soil acidity on farms in the federal state of Brandenburg (Germany). With the help of mobile proximal soil sensors, the lime-relevant soil parameters pH value, texture and soil organic matter were recorded time-saving, cost-effectively and on a small scale. Regulations for processing the sensor data and deriving fertilization recommendations were developed. An important sub-step in determining the lime requirement is the site-specific calibration of the sensor data in order to obtain high-resolution maps of the lime-relevant soil parameters. For this purpose, soil samples were taken from all mapped plots and analyzed for pH, soil organic carbon and grain size distribution. The analyzed results of the first out of three participating farms in the project are available in this data set. Furthermore, in addition to the analysis of the pH value, a basic soil investigation was carried out determining the plant-availability of phosphorus, potassium and magnesium. To date, the dataset consists of a total of 599 entries for pH, 508 for soil organic carbon, total carbon and total nitrogen content, 581 for P, K and Mg, and 374 for soil texture (clay, fine silt, medium silt, coarse silt, fine sand, medium sand, coarse sand).

Half hourly evapotranspiration rates were calculated as a residual of the net radiation, the sensible heat flux and the ground heat flux. Besides the latter energy balance components, also standard meteorological data, such as global radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and -direction and precipitation were continuously measured since April 2016. All instruments were installed at a 3.5 m tall weather mast and the data were automatically collected. The weather mast was installed at the reference plot of Dornburg (Thuringia). That plot is treated as conventional agriculture, in this case crop land.

The initiator of this series of trials was Eduard von Boguslawski, who also foundedthe international working group \"IOSDV\". The LTE \"IOSDV\" in Rauischholzhausen was later continued and managed by Bernd Honermeier (1996 - 2021).\n\nThe original idea of this LTE was to compare three farming systems (farm types), (1) system without organic fertilisation (simulating a cash crop farm), (2) system with organic fertilisation from livestock (farmyard manure, simulating a farm with livestock) and (3) system with organic fertilisation from plant residues (straw, catch crops and digestate from a biogas plant). In these arable farming systems, the classic cash crops sugar beet (since 2010 silage maize), winter wheat and winter barley are grown in a crop rotation (one after the other in time) and at the same time also next to each other every year. Due to the central importance of nitrogen as a plant nutrient, mineral N fertilisation was included as a test factor and combined with all other test factors in four different dosages so that possible interactions could be investigated. Since the LTE was set up at several locations, the influence of site and climatic conditions on soil properties and plant yields as a function of organic and mineral N fertilisation can also be investigated. \n\nThe trial was extended in 1997 by a variant with \"compost fertilisation\"  (without and with certified compost), with the same crop rotation and mineral N fertilisation.\n\nLand Use Type: Field crops\nResearch Theme: Fertilization\nLTE Category: Fertilization\nFarming Category: Conventional\n\nResearch Parameter: \n-Plant: total biomass yield, grain yield, harvest index\n-Soil: Ct, Corg, Nt, nitrate N\n\nFactors:\n- Factor A: Crops (sugar beet/maize, winter wheat, winter barley)\n- Factor B: N-fertilization (5 levels)\n- Factor C: Organic fertilization (3 levels)\n\nResearch question: The trial aims to clarify the long-term effects of different organic fertilisation (manure from livestock compared to organic matter from plants) on soil properties  (Ct/Corg, Nt, Nmin) and on biomass yields of maize, winter wheat and winter barley.

{"text":"Metadata\nTitle: Soil Loss by Water Erosion in EuropeDescription: At a resolution of 100m, this is the most detailed assessment yet of soil erosion by water for the EU. The study applied a modified version of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model, RUSLE 2015, which delivers improved estimates based on higher resolution (100 m compared to 1 km) peer-reviewed inputs of rainfall, soil, topography, land use and management from the year 2010 (the latest year for which most of the input factors are estimated). The model can be used to predict the effect of a range of policy scenarios. It is also replicable, comparable and can be extended to model other regions. All the input layers (Rainfall erosivity, Soil Erodibility, Cover-Management, Topography and Support Practices) have been peer reviewed and published as well.Spatial Coverage: European Union 28 Member StatesResolution: 100mTime Reference:\u00a0 2010, 2016Format: Raster (Grid)Projection: ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal AreaInput data: LUCAS Topsoil, European Soil Database, Lucas Earth Observations, Rainfall Erosivity Database at European Scale (REDES), CORINE Land Cover 2006, COPERNICUS Remote Sensing, EUROSTAT (statistics on Crops, Tillage, Plant residues, cover crops), Digital Elevation Model (DEM) at 25m, Good Agricultural Environmental Condition (GAEC).More Information: RUSLE2015Additional data: Rainfall erosivity (R-factor), Soil Erodibility (K-factor), Topography (LS-factor), Cover Management (C-factor), Support Practices (P-factor) data are also available for download in the corresponding pages.Release Date: 1/9/2015\nSoil erosion by water is one of the major threats to soils in the European Union, with a negative impact on ecosystem services, crop production, drinking water and carbon stocks. The European Commission\u2019s Soil Thematic Strategy has identified soil erosion as a relevant issue for the European Union, and has proposed an approach to monitor soil erosion. A recent published paper presents the application of a modified version of the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) model (RUSLE2015) to estimate soil loss in Europe for the reference year 2010, within which the input factors (Rainfall erosivity, Soil erodibility, Cover-Management, Topography, Support practices) are modelled with the most recently available pan-European datasets. While RUSLE has been used before in Europe, RUSLE2015 improves the quality of estimation by introducing updated (2010), high-resolution (100 m), peer-reviewed input layers. The mean soil loss rate in the European Union\u2019s erosion-prone lands (agricultural, forests and semi-natural areas) was found to be 2.46 t ha-1 yr-1, resulting in a total soil loss of 970 Mt annually. A major benefit of RUSLE2015 is that it can incorporate the effects of policy scenarios based on land-use changes and support practices. The impact of the Good Agricultural and Environmental Condition (GAEC) requirements of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the EU\u2019s guidelines for soil protection can be grouped under land management (reduced/no till, plant residues, cover crops) and support practices (contour farming, maintenance of stone walls and grass margins). The policy interventions (GAEC, Soil Thematic Strategy) over the past decade have reduced the soil loss rate by 9.5% on average in Europe, and by 20% for arable lands. Special attention is given to the 4 * 106 ha of croplands which currently have unsustainable soil loss rates of more than 5 t ha-1 yr-1, and to which policy measures should be targeted. A correspondence article \"Common Agricultural Policy: Tackling soil loss across Europe\" has also been publihed in Nature (October 2015).\nNote: An update of the soil erosion indicator took place for the year 2016 and the results have been published in the paper A Soil Erosion Indicator for Supporting Agricultural, Environmental and Climate Policies in the European Union. Compared to the assessment for 2010, we estimate a very decrease of soil loss by water erosion (<1%) due to a limited increase of applied soil conservation practices and land cover change observed at the EU level. The modelling results suggest that, currently, ca. 25% of the EU land has erosion rates higher than the recommended sustainable threshold (2 t ha\u22121 yr\u22121 ) and more than 6% of agricultural lands suffer from severe erosion (11 t ha\u22121 \u00a0yr\u22121 ).","id":"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu//content/soil-erosion-water-rusle2015"}

Furthermore, the Fusarium and Alternaria infection on wheat ears in the transition zones between kettle hole edge and field and field edge and field in July 2019 and 2020 were determined. 10 different kettle holes and 6 different field edges each year were selected and transects were build up into the field (up to 50m). Fusarium and Alternaria abundance in the transition zones were analyzed by qPCR with extracted DNA out of dried and ground samples. Furthermore, Fusarium species diversity was analyzed by culture-dependent methods using kernels of the wheat ears collected at each sampling point.This table contains the index of all tables forming this data collection.\n\nRelated datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.\nDataset version 1.0","id":"616f4686-078a-4d60-9fd5-3629389010a1"}

{"text":"During the last decades, organic farming has undergone a notable expansion as a common agricultural practice throughout the world. This, together with an increasing demand for fertilizer and pesticide reduction has led to consider different and new approaches. We investigate the effect of Hartmannibacter diazotrophicus strain E19, a plant growth promoting rhizobacterium, in order to enhance the production of wheat and barley under low energy input. For that, we analyze the effect of three factors: organic fertilizer (with and without, only wheat), row distance (15 cm and 50 cm), and bacterial inoculation (E19 and control) at two different organic experimental field stations (Gladbacherhof and Kleinhohenheim). The dataset provides information about different parameter determined from rhizosphere soil and root samples collected at two different developmental stages (flowering and milk/fully ripe), as well as, the grain yield, straw yield, 1000 kernel mass, and seed quality during the seasons 2020-2021 and 2021-2022. The following soil parameter were evaluated: ammonium, nitrate, carbon-nitrogen ratio, microbial biomass, the respiration activity using different carbon sources (glucose, galactose, N-acetylglucosamine, arginine). These data sets are currently under evaluation and complemented with the quantification of strain E19 from root samples through quantitative PCR (qPCR) and the metabarcoding sequencing of the bacterial communities based on 16S rRNA genes obtained from rhizosphere soil samples during the two seasons. \nData obtained for wheat quality are yield parameter (grain yield, straw yield, thousand kernel mass), protein concentration, different fractions of protein (albumin concentration, albumin percentage, gliadin concentration, gliadin percentage, glutenin concentration, glutenin percentage, gluten concentration, gluten percentage, gliadin to glutenin ratio), protein subtractions (\u03c9-gliadin, \u03b3_gliadin, \u03b1/\u03b2_gliadin, HMW, D_LMW, B_LMW, C_LMW, total LMW, HMW/LMW ratio), baking parameters (water absorption, baking loss 1 hour , loaf volume, hardness after 1 hour, hardness after 7 days, freshness retention, springiness after 1 hour, springiness after 7 days, elasticity), cations such as Fe ,Zn, Mg, K, Ca, and important metabolites such as proline, amylose and total starch were determined in order to evaluate the effect of the different factors mentioned above. \nFor barley quality, yield parameter (grain yield, straw yield, thousand kernel mass), protein concentration, different fractions of grain storage protein (albumin concentration, albumin percentage, hordein concentration, hordein percentage, glutelin concentration glutelin percentage), protein subtractions (proteinZ, C-hordein, B-hordein, Y-hordein, HMW, D_LMW, B_LMW, C_LMW, total_LMW, HMW/LMW ratio), Fe , Zn, Mg, K, Ca, proline, amylose and total starch were determined in order to evaluate the effect of the different factors.

{"text":"In recent years, agricultural machinery became steadily larger and heavier. Especially under wet soil conditions, when soil is susceptible to compaction, heavy wheel load field traffic can lead to harmful soil compaction. This data set contains soil data from a wheeling experiment with an agricultural vehicle (3-axle sugar beet harvester). The experiment was conducted in 2016 on an agricultural test field in Adenstedt (Hildesheim district, Lower Saxony, Germany). The soil type is Stagnic Luvisol derived from Loess and was tilled with a cultivator up to a depth of 25 cm (reduced tillage). For the wheeling experiment, the harvester passed defined plots in the field with a full bunker (total weight: 62 t) and a half full bunker (total weight: 49 t). Maximum soil pressure and plastic soil deformation evoked by harvester passing was measured simultaneously with a multi-channel device consisting of Bolling probes (Bolling, 1987) and hydrostatic measuring hoses (Nolting et al., 2006). Maximum soil pressure and plastic soil deformation was measured in 20, 35, and 50 cm depth directly below the center of the tires. To investigate changes in soil physical parameters, soil structure, and soil functions caused by harvester driving, undisturbed soil cores (100 cm\u00b3) were taken before (unwheeled) and after wheeling (wheeled). Wheeling variants in the inner field area were sugar beet harvester with half full bunker and full bunker volume driving with all wheels in the same track (3 wheel passes). The wheeling variant of the headland area was sugar beet harvester with full bunker volume and multiple wheel passes in front of the sugar beet clamp. The sampling sites were located both in the inner field area and in the headlands. Two soil pits were sampled per wheeling variant in the inner field area and one soil pit in the headlands. A total of 30 undisturbed soil samples were taken per each soil pit, 10 per each soil depth (20, 35, 50 cm). The soil biopores were counted in every one of the three soil depths. 5 of the 10 undisturbed sampling rings were used to investigate soil water retention and the other 5 for saturated hydraulic conductivity. The determination of pF values was conducted in the soil laboratory using sand and clay boxes as well as pressure pots according to DIN ISO 11274. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was analyzed using a soil water permeameter (open system) according to ISO / FDIS 17312. The soil parameters, total pore volume, air capacity, field capacity, usable field capacity, permanent wilting point, dry bulk density, and current water content during soil sampling were derived from the soil laboratory results.\n\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences","id":"65c50647-b035-43a5-b1aa-1f03c6f8ee2e"}

{"text":"We present a comprehensive, high-quality dataset characterising soil-vegetation and land-surface processes from continuous measurements conducted in two climatically contrasting study regions in South West Germany: the warmer and drier Kraichgau region with a mean temperature of 9.7\u00b0C and annual precipitation of 890 mm, and the cooler and wetter Swabian. Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents. One station in each region has now been set up as continuous observatories of state variables and fluxes in intensively managed agricultural fields.\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences\nThe corresponding publication can be accessed here:\u00a0https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2020-396\u00a0\nDataset version 1.1  This table contains Site 3 soil data.\n\nRelated datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.","id":"6a29484a-948d-4b83-ab86-358d0a9a1a3a"}

{"text":"Over 100 km2 of agricultural soils have been restored after open-cast lignite mining in the area between Aachen, Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany). The applied restoration technique leads to a massive soil disturbance in three ways: soil structure is lost by excavation and mixing; topsoil is diluted with subsoil and loess parent material, raising pH and lowering organic carbon content; soil biology is reduced. This data set contains physical and chemical soil parameters along a pseudo-chronosequence of recultivated soils after open-cast mining and one naturally grown Luvisol (original soil), which never was influenced by mining. Soils between 2016 and 2011 were managed by farmers of the mining company RWE AG (Germany). Soils between 2006 and 1964, as well as the original soil, were managed by local farmers. Farmers of conventional agricultural management followed the guidelines and recommendations of the German Federal Soil Protection Act. Farmers used official agricultural services like the chamber of agriculture to comply with the German fertilization regulation and good professional practice of plant protection. Most parameters were determined on basis of standardized VDLUFA and DIN guidelines. Soil water content ranged between 20 and 24% soil dry weight in March and June, except the freshly deposed soil substrate of 2016. Soil texture was generally silty loam. pH measured in CaCl2 ranged between 7.4 and 7.9, except in the original Luvisol with pH of 6.4. Only recultivated soils contained inorganic C in form of CaCO3. In March, original soil contained 1.6 mg NH4-N kg. All other recultivated soils ranged between 0.06 and 0.8 mg NH4-N kg. In June, all soils ranged at NH4-N concentrations of 0.02 to 0.2 mg kg. In March, NO3-N ranged between 23 and 40 mg kg in soils deposed in 2012, 2011, 2006, and in the original soil. All other soils ranged between 0.1-4.5 mg NO3-N kg. In June, NO3-N ranged at a level of 0.1 to 7 mg N kg-1 in all soils. Smin concentrations in the original soil were between 7 and 3 mg S kg-1 in both sampling seasons (March and June), respectively. All recultivated soils contained 1 and 12 mg S kg-1 in March. In June, the Smin concentrations ranged between 1 and 6 mg S kg-1 in recultivated soils. A clear trend for plant-accessible P(CAL) occurred in the following order: freshly deposed (12 mg kg-1)  younger (10 to 23 mg kg-1) to older recultivation soils (49-106 mg kg) \u2264 original soil (101 mg kg, mean of both seasons).  During both sampling seasons, plant-accessible K(CAL) was lower in recultivated soil between year 2016 and 2011, ranging between 33 to 60 mg K kg. All other soils, including the original soil, had higher K(CAL) concentrations, ranging between 88 and 188 mg K kg. Original soil had the largest plant-accessible Mg concentrations with 132 and 150 mg kg in March and June, respectively. In March, only the soil recultivated in 2006 showed a similarly large concentration of plant-accessible Mg with 122 mg kg-1. In all other cases, accessible Mg ranged between 56 and 108 mg Mg kg-1. Organic carbon content showed a clear gradient in the following order: freshly deposed soil substrate of 2016 (0.3% Corg)  younger (0.4%) to older recultivation soils (0.8%)  original soil (1.4%). Total nitrogen content showed the following gradient: freshly (0.05% Nt)  younger (0.06%) to older recultivation soils (0.11%)  original soil (0.14%). Total calcium, magnesium, boron, and CaCO3 showed a significant negative correlation with age of the soil substrate. Total K and Fe tended to increase with soil substrate age. Manganese, phosphorus, and sulfur were significantly positive correlated with soil substrate age.

Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents.

{"text":"Drainage and agricultural use transform natural peatlands from a net carbon (C) sink to a net C source. Rewetting of peatlands, despite of high methane (CH4) emissions, holds the potential to mitigate climate change by greatly reducing CO2 emissions. However, the time span for this transition is unknown because most studies are limited to a few years. Especially, non-permanent open water areas often created after rewetting, are highly productive. Here, we present 14 consecutive years of CH4 flux measurements following rewetting of a formerly long-term drained peatland in the Peene valley. Measurements were made at two rewetted sites (non-inundated vs. inundated) using manual chambers. During the study period, significant differences in measured CH4 emissions occurred. In general, these differences overlapped with stages of ecosystem transition from a cultivated grassland to a polytrophic lake dominated by emergent helophytes, but could also be additionally explained by other variables. This transition started with a rapid vegetation shift from dying cultivated grasses to open water floating and submerged hydrophytes and significantly increased CH4 emissions. Since 2008, helophytes have gradually spread from the shoreline into the open water area, especially in drier years. This process was periodically delayed by exceptional inundation and eventually resulted in the inundated site being covered by emergent helophytes. While the period between 2009 and 2015 showed exceptionally high CH4 emissions, these decreased significantly after cattail and other emergent helophytes became dominant at the inundated site. Therefore, CH4 emissions declined only after ten years of transition following rewetting, potentilly reaching a new steady state. Overall, this study highlights the importance of an integrative approach to understand the shallow lakes CH4 biogeochemistry, encompassing the entire area with its mosaic of different vegetation forms. This should be ideally done through a study design including proper measurement site allocation as well as long-term measurements.This table contains annual fluxes.\n\nRelated datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.\nDataset version 1.0","id":"7f306b79-ee88-43aa-86d0-7b741fa80cd2"}

The experiment was set up as a strip design with four replicates, the treatments being farmyard manure treatments with and without biodynamic preparations and mineral fertilization, each at various levels. The objective of the project was to study the product quality of vegetables. After this four year project, interesting differences began to emerge with respect to the soil parameters of organic and mineral treatments. Thus the trial was continued. After some years of a transitional period without particular investigations, a detailed soil biological project was carried out in 1989-1991, focusing on the effects of fertilization upon C- and N-dynamics, enzyme activities and microbial biomass in the soil. A third experimental period (from 1992 to 2009) has focused on the yield formation of cultivated crops and the long-term effects of fertilization treatments upon soil and crop development.

{"text":"The phosphorus (P) taken up by organisms cannot be substituted from any other element; the only source of an increasing P demand for feeding the growing global population is mineable rock phosphate, upgraded to mineral P fertilizer. There are concerns about the global reserves of rock phosphates, expressed in terms of \u201cpeak phosphorus\u201d (demand production). Bone char (BC) produced of de-fatted and de-gelatinized bones (15% P, 28% Calcium, 1% Magnesium) from slaughterhouses by a pyrolysis process could be an alternative source of P. Phosphorus in BC is mainly bound in a structure similar to hydroxylapatite (HA) in accordance with their origin from bones. Generally, P in HA is of low solubility and, consequently, it cannot be expected that bones or BC have a high fertilization value. Consequently, further attempts were directed to increase the P solubility of BC by a sulfur (S) enrichment leading to so called BCplus (patent DE102011010525). \nA former long-term field P fertilization trial (1985-2008) led to distinctive differences in available soil P (PCAL) concentrations.

According to their mean PCAL concentrations (0-30 cm) one third of the plots were assigned to soil class A (11 mg kg-1 PCAL), B (21 mg kg-1 PCAL), and C (47 mg kg-1 PCAL) each. The experiment was set up as a completely randomized block design with three replicates, a plot size of 5.75 m * 17.5 m, and crop rotation of winter barley, winter oilseed rape, winter wheat, lupine and winter rye. Chisel ploughing and ploughing to a depth of 25 cm incorporates crop residues before seeding. Additionally to a control without P fertilization (P0), three different types of P fertilizer (BC, BCplus, TSP) are applied to an equivalent of 45 kg ha-1 P once a year shortly before seeding since autumn 2013.  \nThis data set presents the first harvest of winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L., variety OTTO) in 2014.\n\nResearch domain: Plant Nutrition","id":"8170ee67-01c9-42b6-82ae-1b6442e5bdc3"}
{"text":"We present a comprehensive, high-quality dataset characterising soil-vegetation and land-surface processes from continuous measurements conducted in two climatically contrasting study regions in South West Germany: the warmer and drier Kraichgau region with a mean temperature of 9.7\u00b0C and annual precipitation of 890 mm, and the cooler and wetter Swabian. Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents.

{"text":"Organic and mineral fertilization in combination are relevant factors which are controlling availability of mineral nutrients and humus development. In contrast to mineral fertilizer, humus acts as long-term source of nutrients and is a basis element of soil fertility. The international fertilization trial (IOSDV) at the research facility Rinkenbergerhof at the LUFA Speyer (Germany) was set up in the year 1984 and was planted with the following crop rotation: winter wheat, winter barley, and sugar beet. This data set comprises only the soil management variant \u201cploughing\u201d. Other treatment factors were: (1) no organic amendment, farmyard (horse) manure treatment every three years to sugar beet fields, and crop residues + catch crop treatment; (2) no, suboptimal, optimal, and excess mineral N fertilization. More experimental details are available in German from the LUFA Speyer (Germany): VDLUFA, 121.

September 2009, Karlsruhe, Schriftenreihe Bd. 65/2009, ISBN 978-3-941273-07-8 (German). Parameters of the data set were determined on basis of standardized VDLUFA and DIN guidelines by the LUFA Speyer (Germany). The data set contains data of 252 samples, which were sampled during four sampling seasons with winter barley and sugar beet as crop plant. Soil dry matter content ranged between 85 and 93% of the fresh mass during all four sampling dates. Gravimetric water content was clearly influenced by the organic amendment treatment (factor 1) and the applied sampling depths. Soil texture was weakly loamy sand, loamy sand, and sandy loam, respectively. pH values in CaCl2 soil extracts showed a negative correlation with the level of additional mineral N fertilization. Ammonium and nitrate N in soil were clearly related to the amount of applied mineral N. Plant-accessible mineral S decreased in soil during the whole sampling period. Content of Smin was positively related to the mineral N fertilization level, but negatively with the soil depth. Plant-accessible P(CAL) decreased during the time of sampling and was negatively related with an increasing level of co-applied mineral N. Plant-accessible K(CAL) responded to the organic soil amendment treatment and showed a negative relation to the additional mineral N fertilization. Accessible Mg indicated no response to the organic amendment treatment, mineral N treatment, sampling depths, and season. Total element concentrations were only determined in soil of the first sampling. Organic carbon was positively stimulated due to the decades of organic amendment practice, but not due to the mineral N application. Total nitrogen in soil indicated also a strong dependence on the long-term organic amendment, without clear relation to the mineral N fertilization level. Total contents of Ca, Mg, K, Fe, Mn, and B in soil indicated no response to the organic amendment, mineral N treatment, soil depth, and sampling season. Interestingly, total P content in soil was negatively related to the mineral N level applied during the consecutive years. In contrast, total S content was positively related with both, the organic amendment and mineral N-level treatment. Related publications: Schmid, C.

{"text":"Meliorative, partial deep tillage (PDT) has a high potential for a permanent increase in the carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stocks. Through PDT, the lower-concentration, C and N-poor subsoil is tilled upwards towards the surface, the topsoil material is buried in the subsoil and simultaneously mixed, resulting in a C and N dilution of the topsoil. However, whether this might temporarily enhance the C and N accumulation until the former equilibrium of a diluted topsoil is reached is yet unclear. To clarify this, we conducted a model experiment simulating subsoil mixing into topsoil and analysed CO2 and N2O emissions, considering soil type, erosion state and digestate application.\nWe used a non-eroded Albic Luvisol (LL), eroded Albic Luvisol (eLL), and a strongly eroded Calcaric Regosol (RZ) soils from the CarboZALF experimental area in the Uckermark, Germany. Each soil's topsoil was mixed with 20% material from the respective subsoil and incubated for 26 days in an automated, gas exchange measuring system. Undiluted, unfertilised substrates served as controls, and were compared with those receiving organic fertiliser (Digestate). Digestate addition uniformly increased CO2 emissions across all soil types and notably elevated N2O emissions, particularly in eLL soil. A moderate increase in RZ and the smallest increase in LL soil were observed. Topsoil dilution reduced CO2 release in all variants, especially in fertilised variants, but only moderately reduced N2O emissions in eLL soil upon subsoil and digestate addition. Conversely, slight increases in N2O release were observed in the other two soils under these conditions.\n\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences\n\nResearch question: We pursued the following hypotheses: the addition of digestate always leads to a short-term increase in CO2 and N2O release; soil dilution leads to a significant reduction in CO2 and N2O release because the available C and N quantities are reduced in the diluted and undersaturated topsoil or a higher proportion of the C and N from the digestate is bound in the soil; and the effect of soil dilution and digestate is somewhat modified by the degree of erosion of the soil.","id":"85040363-b699-4af0-9355-e47d2ebeee1b"}

It is a supplement to the research article DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0238876. \n\nIn the first experiment, plants of M26 were grown in a biotest, including untreated and disinfected ARD soil from the three ORDIAmur reference sites Ellerhoop, Heidgraben and Ruthe. Plant shoot length was recorded over a course of eight weeks. After 0, 1, 3 and 7 days, root samples for gene expression analysis were taken. Further root samples for phytoalexin analysis were taken after 3, 7, 10 and 56 days. After 8 weeks, shoot and root fresh and dry masses were determined from the remaining plants to assess ARD severity in the soils. The genes biphenyl synthase 3 (BIS3), biphenyl 4-hydroxylase (B4Hb) and ethylene-responsive transcription factor 1B (ERF1B) were identified for further testing. \n\nIn experiment 2, the expression of BIS3, B4Hb and ERF1B was investigated in M26 in response to the stressors heat, high salinity and nutrient starvation, which were applied in peat substrate (heat, salt) or quartz sand (nutrient starvation). Furthermore, grass soil from Heidgraben with no previous apple culture was tested. ARD soil from Heidgraben and peat substrate served as controls. Gene expression was investigated in the roots after 7 and 14 days and phytoalexin contents were analyzed after 14 days. Shoot lengths were recorded weekly and after 8 weeks and fresh and dry masses of shots and roots were taken. A nutrient analysis was conducted with the shoot material to investigate the effects of the nutrient starvation. The second experiment revealed a response of ERF1B to heat stress. All three genes responded to grass soil but to a lesser extent than to ARD soil after two weeks.\n\nResearch domain: Plant Breeding\n\nResearch question: This study aimed at the identification and characterization biomarkers for apple replant disease (ARD). The first experiment aimed at narrowing down a set of previously identified set of candidate genes by studying their expression in apple roots in a biotest with soil from three ARD sites.

{"text":"This dataset includes data on soil stoichiometry (total organic carbon and total nitrogen), soil microbial stoichiometry (microbial biomass carbon, and -nitrogen), and microbial basal respiration along a 55 year space-for-time chronosequence of reclaimed agricultural land after brown coal mining. Samples were taken in May 2019 from the restored land adjacent to the open-cast brown coal mine Inden, NRW Germany (6\u25e615\u20190\u2019E to 6\u25e621\u20190\u2019E and 50\u25e650\u20195\u2019N to 50\u25e653\u20190\u2019N). \nThirteen reclaimed sites of ages 1, 2, 4, 6, 7, 13, 18, 24, 29, 40, 44, 48 and 55 years after reclamation were sampled. At each site, soil was sampled from the reclaimed arable field and from the grass margins directly adjacent. Exceptions are for the two youngest sites aged one-two years restored in 2017 and 2018, where no grass margins were present. The 2018 site further differed from other sites in that there were 2 arable land use types; bare soil with no vegetation (2018_F) and land cultivated with Triticale sp instead of Alfalfa (2018_G); and lastly, a site of unlevelled freshly deposited mounds of soil approximately 1m high (2018_FD). \nThe soils from the grass margins were formed from the same loess material as the reclaimed arable fields of the same age, but differed in that they had continuous vegetation cover and were not ploughed. Per field, five technical replicates, each consisting of five pooled soil cores (6 cm \u00d8, with a depth of 10 cm), were collected. At the adjacent grass strips three technical replicates consisting each of two soil cores were sampled. All samples were sieved (2mm), roots and stones removed and stored at 4\u00b0C prior to analysis.\nThe mining company RWE was responsible for the restoration of the land after mining and managed the sites for 7 years before returning the land to the previous owners. The reclamation process is highly standardized. New agricultural top soils are formed of a 2m layer of homogenized loess substrate (containing 1% former topsoil), which are continuously restored at the backside of the mine once excavation is finished.\nIn the first three years after reclamation, fields are cultivated with alfalfa (Medicago sativa) in the absence of fertiliser and biocides. Four to seven years after reclamation, fields typically undergo a wheat and barley crop rotation and are fertilised with N:P:K (1:0.4:0.6) of 437 kg ha\u22121 annum\u22121.\nAfter 7 years of recultivation by RWE, soils were returned to the original land owners and were managed with a sugar beet-winter wheat crop rotation. Farmers resumed conventional agricultural management as per the German Federal Soil Protection Act. Farmers used official agricultural services like the chamber of agriculture to comply with the German fertilization regulation and good professional practice of plant protection. \nChloroform fumigation extraction method CFE) was used to determine microbial biomass carbon and nitrogen. In the particularly nutrient poor soils, it was not possible to differentiate the nutrients stemming from the microbial biomass from the background nutrient levels.

This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents.

{"text":"Sustaining, or even increasing yields while improving the Water use efficiency (WUE) of irrigated rice is vital to cope with both the increasing risks of water scarcity and the feeding of the growing population in sub-Saharan Africa This study aims to improve the WUE for irrigated rice cultivation in central Benin. A field experiment was established and measurements performed from November 2022 to March 2023 at Koussin l\u00e9l\u00e9, Cove district, using a split-plot experimental design. The main plot was assigned to water management technologies that included continuous flooding and two thresholds of periodic drying irrigation to 15 cm and 25 cm soil depth. The subplot was assigned to the nitrogen fertilizer regime which includes 90 kg ha-1 (farmer\u2019s practice) and 120 kg ha-1 (enhanced amount of fertilizer). Based on biweekly conducted manual closed chamber (A: 0.16m2; V:0.16m3) measurements of evapotranspiration (ET) and CO2 exchange (ecosystem respiration (Reco) and net ecosystem exchange (NEE)), the seasonal dynamics in WUE were assessed as canopy (cWUE) and ecosystem water use efficiency (eWUE), respectively. Canopy gas exchange measurements were performed using a novel, low-cost ET and CO2 flux logger system (Macagga et al. 2024; RelatedIdentifier TAB1). Measured CO2 and ET fluxes were calculated using a modular R script described in detail by Hoffmann et al. (2015; Reco/NEE; RelatedIdentifier TAB2) and Dahlmann et al. (2022; ET; RelatedIdentifier TAB3). In addition to cWUE and eWUE, the crop season WUE was calculated as grain (gWUE) and biomass water use efficiency (bWUE). Results showed that the maximum grain yield (6.19 Mg ha-1) was observed for the continuous flooding rice cultivation receiving 120 Kg N ha-1 even though it was only 6.9 % higher than the yield recorded for the periodic drying at -15cm. The cWUE and eWUE followed the same pattern but were generally higher for periodic drying at -15cm under N90 with 2.63 g C (Kg H2O)-1 d-1 and 1.25 g C (Kg H2O)-1 d-1 respectively. Furthermore, this particular treatment also recorded the highest values for all the cumulative WUE parameters. Our findings emphasize the adoption of the periodic drying irrigation regime with an application rate of N90 Kg. ha-1 for more sustainable irrigated rice production.

The objective of the sub project was to investigate the effect of agroforestry on evapotranspiration on a whole system scale. We applied the so called surface energy balance method to calculate half hourly evapotranspiration rates. Half hourly evapotranspiration rates were calculated as a residual of the net radiation, the sensible heat flux and the ground heat flux. Besides the latter energy balance components, also standard meteorological data, such as global radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and -direction and precipitation were continuously measured since March 2016. All instruments were installed at a 3.5 m tall weather mast and the data were automatically collected. The weather mast was installed at the reference plot of Mariensee. That plot is treated as conventional agriculture, in this case gras land.

{"text":"A central aspect when including catch crops into a crop rotation is the conservation of nutrients in their biomass for the subsequently grown crop. Therefore, it is important to qualify and to quantify the nutrient accumulation in the biomass of catch crop species. Since it was often described, that mixtures yield higher biomasses than pure stands of catch crops, we evaluated the nutrient scavenging potential of pure stands vs. mixtures. \nTest objects were the four species mustard, phacelia, bristle oat and Egyptian clover either grown in pure stands (sowing densities: mustard - 300, phacelia - 706, bristle oat - 588, Egyptian clover - 833) or in a 4-species mixture (sowing densities: mustard - 67, phacelia - 294, bristle oat - 53, Egyptian clover - 233). Additionally, a commercial mixture of the DSV with a higher species diversity called TerraLife MaisPro was included in the experiment. Their single-species nutrient accumulation was evaluated after 2.5 months of cultivation in total shoot material (dryed for 3 d at 80 \u00b0C and ground in a mill) obtained from two sites in Germany (Asendorf - Lower Saxony and Triesdorf - Bavaria), and at two initial starting points of the respective wheat-catch crop-maize long-term rotation (2015 and 2016) - in total 4 test environments. \nGenerally, nutrient concentrations in the shoot biomass often followed species-specific patterns, e.g. phacelia and oat which are described to have a shallow root system with a high amount of fine roots in the upper soil layers had consistently highest P and K concentrations, S, which is prone to leaching, was most concentrated in the cruciferous species mustard, Ca concentration was highest in phacelia but very low abundant in oat as grass species or Mg was highest in clover since photosynthesis rate must be kept high because biologically fixed N has to be incorporated into carbon skeletons. Increasing interspecific competition in the mix (at higher plant survival rates or at vigorous plant development) favored higher concentrations of several nutrients in some of the species, e.g. higher P concentration in phacelia when cultivated in the 4-species mix. Non-favorable conditions like less water availability led, against this, to higher N concentrations in clover likely due to the establishment of N fixation (Triesdorf 2015 and Asendorf 2016).\nHowever, total nutrient scavenging was largely influenced by the biomass formed by a catch crop variant. In this case, above-ground nutrient conservation capacities were mostly equally high in mustard, phacelia, partially oat and the mixed cultures. Only in one test environment (Triesdorf 2016) where quite loose pure stands established, the mixed cultivation offered a larger nutrient conservation capacity via the production of higher total biomass.","id":"8d34ddab-2bc9-4288-869b-a4afdd68f0dd"}

{"text":"Saturated and near-saturated hydraulic conductivities K (mm/h) are important soil properties that determine the partitioning of precipitation into surface runoff and infiltration and indicate soil susceptibility to preferential flow as well as soil aeration properties. Measurements of saturated and near-saturated soil hydraulic conductivities are time consuming and not practical for larger scales where they are mostly needed. The research community has therefore put effort in deriving pedotransfer functions to predict K using proxy variables. The precision of such pedotransfer functions has been very modest, however. As a result, recent studies have focused on assembling and analyzing bigger databases, aiming to find better predictors for the saturated and near-saturated soil hydraulic conductivities. A prominent example is the meta-database on tension-disk infiltrometer data compiled by Jarvis et al. (2013. Influence of soil, land use and climatic factors on the hydraulic conductivity of soil. Hydrology and Earth System Sciences 17(12), 5185-5195), who found that climate variables were better correlated with K than soil properties.

{"text":"A central aspect when including catch crops into a crop rotation is the conservation of nutrients in their biomass for the subsequently grown crop. Numerous studies have been made evaluating the above-ground nutrient scavenging potential of different catch crop species. Often it was thereby described, that mixtures yield higher biomasses than pure stands of catch crops. An assumption is the ecological concept of niche differentiation: Higher biomass production in mixtures might rely on vertical root niche differentiation in the soil resulting in overall better nutrient exploitation when species with different root system distribution and nutrient uptake abilities are cultivated together. However, due to the general difficulty of root biomass quantification in soil samples paired with the even more challenging question of assigning root masses to different species, studies proving this niche differentiation concept are rare.\nIn the past years DNA-based techniques were more and more used for species discrimination in soil samples, but root biomass quantification remains difficult. We therefore developed a method for root biomass quantification of different species in soil samples: Using species-specific primers on the non-conserved ITS1 or ITS2 region species discrimination could be made based on root DNA. In the following, a qPCR-based quantification step with species-specific standard curves for cycle threshold values at known root weight was used to quantify the vertical root biomass distribution of different catch crop species in soil cores up to 90 cm depth in pure stands vs. a mixture. \nTest objects were the four species mustard (Sinapis alba), phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia), bristle oat (Avena strigosa) and Egyptian clover (Trifolium alexandrinum), either grown in pure stands or in a 4-species mixture. Their vertical root system distribution was evaluated in soil cores with 7 cm diameter obtained from two sites in Germany (Asendorf - Lower Saxony and Triesdorf - Bavaria), and at two initial starting points of the respective wheat-catch crop-maize long-term rotation (2015 and 2016) - in total 4 test environments. \nRepeatedly at both sites and in both years, mustard and phacelia developed the deepest root systems (usually until 80 cm depths), followed by oat reaching site-specifically between 50 and 60 cm depth and clover being only able to root 20-30 cm deep after 2.5 months of cultivation. Oat or mustard developed site-specifically the largest root systems in Asendorf or Triesdorf, respectively among the pure stands. Although the individual-species seeding rates were lower in the mixed stand compared to the respective pure stands, mustard and phacelia developed similar root biomass under both conditions. Against this, the other two slower developing species were strongly repressed in root biomass formation in the mix. In total, the mix often developed the largest root biomass among all variants.\nThe nutrient accumulation of the different catch crop species has been already published under \u201cCatch crop nutrient uptake 1st crop rotation cycle\u201d.","id":"90722934-7e78-45ef-b620-60b4cee02a6c"}

{"text":"In recent years, agricultural machinery became steadily larger and heavier. Especially under wet soil conditions, when soil is susceptible to compaction, heavy wheel load field traffic can lead to harmful soil compaction. This data set contains soil data from a wheeling experiment with an agricultural vehicle (2-axle combine harvester with bunker; total weight: 17 t). The experiment was conducted in 2017 on an agricultural test field in Adenstedt (Hildesheim district, Lower Saxony, Germany) during the harvest campaign. The soil type is Stagnic Luvisol derived from Loess and was conventionally tilled with a plough up to a depth of 28 cm. The cultivated crop was winter wheat. For the wheeling experiment, a combine harvester with full bunker volume passed defined plots in the field. In the inner field area, the number of wheel passes were 2 and in the headlands the number of wheel passes were 8. The sampling sites were both located in the inner field area and in the headlands. To investigate changes in soil physical parameters, soil structure, and soil functions caused by combine harvester driving, undisturbed soil cores (100 cm\u00b3) were taken before (unwheeled) and after wheeling (wheeled). The unwheeled soil samples were taken in 20, 35, and 50 depth and the wheeled soil samples in 20, 35, and 50 cm depth. In the inner field area, two soil pits were sampled per wheeling variant and in the headlands, one soil pit was sampled per wheeling variant. Additionally, the soil biopores were counted in every one of the three soil depths. A total of 30 undisturbed soil samples were taken per each soil pit, 10 per each soil depth. 5 of the 10 undisturbed sampling rings were used to investigate soil water retention and the other 5 for saturated hydraulic conductivity. The determination of pF values was conducted in the soil laboratory using sand and clay boxes as well as pressure pots according to DIN ISO 11274.

This limitation is likely because the small-scale differences in soil properties and fertility induced by erosion (i.e. ranges of erosion states) have barely been considered in studies quantifying N2O emissions from croplands. There are, however, indications that the erosion state itself strongly impacts N2O fluxes, similar to the N fertilizer form. Therefore, our investigations aimed to further explore these indications.

The main goal of the sub project was to investigate the effect of agroforestry on evapotranspiration on a system scale. We applied the so called surface energy balance method to calculate half hourly evapotranspiration rates. For that, half hourly evapotranspiration rates were calculated as a residual of the net radiation, the sensible heat flux and the ground heat flux. Besides the latter energy balance components, also standard meteorological data, such as global radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and -direction, air pressure and precipitation were continuously measured since March 2016. All instruments were installed at a 10 m tall weather mast and the data were automatically collected. The weather mast was installed directly at the agroforestry plot of Wendhausen. The agroforestry system in Wendhausen is of a crop land alley cropping type, where poplar tree strips and crop land alternate.

{"text":"Organic and mineral fertilization in combination are relevant factors which are controlling availability of mineral nutrients and humus development. In contrast to mineral fertilizer, humus acts as long-term source of nutrients and is a basis element of soil fertility. The international fertilization trial (IOSDV) at the research facility Rinkenbergerhof at the LUFA Speyer (Germany) was set up in the year 1984 and planted with a repeating crop rotation: winter wheat, winter barley, and sugar beet. This data set comprises only the soil management variant \u201cploughing\u201d. Other treatment factors were: (1) no organic amendment, farmyard (horse) manure treatment every three years to sugar beet fields, and crop residues + catch crop treatment; (2) without and with mineral N fertilization. More experimental details are available in German from the LUFA Speyer (Germany): VDLUFA, 121.

Parameters of the data set were determined on basis of standardized VDLUFA and DIN guidelines by the LUFA Speyer (Germany). The data set contains data of 72 samples, which were sampled during four sampling seasons with winter barley and sugar beet as crop plant and contained 3 field replicates of 6 treatment combinations. The bacterial bulk soil community structure of all samples was characterised by amplicon sequencing of the V1-V2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using primers 27F (5\u2032-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGC-3\u2032) and 357R (5'-CTGCTGCCTYCCGTA-3'). Results show that the bacterial community in the long term is mainly altered by mineral fertilization and, on a lower level by horse manure. The bacterial class Bacilli was an evident positive responder to manure application. However, both manure and crop residues are valueable amendments for farmland, since both mitigate the negative effects of mineral fertilizer on the connectivity of bacterial interaction networks.

So far, SRS has successfully been applied to microbial community data. The normalization by SRS reduces the number of reads in each sample in such a way that (i) the total count equals Cmin, (ii) each removed OTU is less or equally abundant that any preserved OTU, and (iii) the relative frequencies of OTUs remaining in the sample after normalization are as close as possible to the frequencies in the original sample. The algorithm consists of two steps. In the first step, the counts for all OTUs are divided by a scaling factor chosen in such a way that the sum of the scaled counts (Cscaled with integer or non-integer values) equals Cmin. The relative frequencies of all OTUs remain unchanged. In the second step, the non-integer count values are converted into integers by an algorithm that we dub ranked subsampling. The scaled count Cscaled for each OTU is split into the integer-part Cint by truncating the digits after the decimal separator (Cint = floor(Cscaled)) and the fractional part Cfrac (Cfrac = Cscaled - Cint). Since \u03a3Cint \u2264 Cmin, additional \u2206C = Cmin - \u03a3Cint reads have to be added to the library to reach the total count of Cmin. This is achieved as follows. OTUs are ranked in the descending order of their Cfrac values, which lie in the open interval (0, 1). Beginning with the OTU of the highest rank, single count per OTU is added to the normalized library until the total number of added counts reaches \u2206C and the sum of all counts in the normalized library equals Cmin. For example, if \u2206C = 5 and the seven top Cfrac values are 0.96, 0.96, 0.88, 0.55, 0.55, 0.55, and 0.55, the following counts are added: a single count for each OTU with Cfrac of 0.96; a single count for the OTU with Cfrac of 0.88; and a single count each for two OTUs among those with Cfrac of 0.55. When the lowest Cfrag involved in picking \u2206C counts is shared by several OTUs, the OTUs used for adding a single count to the library are selected in the order of their Cint values. This selection minimizes the effect of normalization on the relative frequencies of OTUs. OTUs with identical Cfrag as well as Cint are sampled randomly without replacement.","id":"9730f571-96c7-4490-b5c2-e99d4c63f572"}

Margin of fields were used as model since it shows a particularly high colonization density of earthworms. On both test sites the drilosphere soil (surface of biopores) showed in comparison to the control (soil without visible biopores) partially and slightly higher activities of hydrolytic enzymes (acid/ alkaline phosphomonoesterases, \u03b2 glucosidase, phosphodiesterase) and higher concentrations of plant available (double lactacte extract) phosphorus. The impact of location clearly surpassed the influence of biopores on P mobilization. In the subsoil was a partially increased P mobilization and a minor increased P availability present while in the top soil proved almost no significant effects on the P cycle.

{"text":"Long-term field experiments (LTEs) are crucial sources of knowledge on agricultural soil management. They are vitally important in monitoring, understanding and proving the changes in soil properties and crop production occurring as a result of agricultural management practices and climate change. Long-term field experiments will also be essential in the future and cannot be replaced by new analytical techniques or models; on the contrary, they are an indispensable basis for the calibration and validation of these techniques. Because of longevity, it is fairly costly to maintain them. Therefore, efforts aiming at more extensive and cooperative use of LTEs and the corresponding data should be promoted.

{"text":"Over 100 km\u00b2 of agricultural soils have been restored after open-cast lignite mining in the area between Aachen, Cologne and D\u00fcsseldorf (Germany). The applied restoration technique leads to a massive soil disturbance in three ways: soil structure is lost by excavation and mixing; topsoil is diluted with subsoil and loess parent material, raising pH and lowering organic carbon content; soil biology is reduced. This data set contains data on the bacterial community composition along a pseudo-chronosequence of recultivated soils after open-cast mining and one naturally grown Luvisol (original soil), which was never influenced by mining. Soils between 2016 and 2011 were managed by farmers of the mining company RWE AG (Germany). Soils between 2006 and 1964, as well as the original soil, were managed by local farmers. Farmers of conventional agricultural management followed the guidelines and recommendations of the German Federal Soil Protection Act. Farmers used official agricultural services like the chamber of agriculture to comply with the German fertilization regulation and good professional practice of plant protection. Soil parameters were determined on basis of standardized VDLUFA and DIN guidelines and those data are available on the BonaRes Data Server (INPLAMINT.Nutrient.Status.Field.Experiment.Chronosequence: https://maps.bonares.de/mapapps/resources/apps/bonares/index.html?lang=en&doi=72ca6e98-5aab-4884-bf1b-56931482eb94). Soil water content ranged between 20 and 24% soil dry weight in March and June, except the freshly deposed soil substrate of 2016. Soil texture was generally silty loam. pH measured in CaCl2 ranged between 7.4 and 7.9, except in the original Luvisol with pH of 6.4. Only recultivated soils contained inorganic C in form of CaCO3. The bacterial abundance was determined using quantitative real-time PCR of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene (FP: 5\u2032-GGTAGTCYAYGCMSTAAACG-3\u2032, RP: 5\u2032-GACARCCATGCASCACCTG-3\u2032). The bacterial community structure of 10 sites with 4 pseudo-replicates was characterised by amplicon sequencing of the V1-V2 region of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene using primers 27F (5\u2032-AGAGTTTGATCMTGGC-3\u2032) and 357R (5'-CTGCTGCCTYCCGTA-3'). Results show that bacterial abundance as well as alpha-diversity quickly recovers to levels of the original soil. However, the bacterial community structure is strongly changed even 52 years after site restoration. Furthermore, it was observed that the bacterial community structure shifts depending on land use changes and weathering of the initial soil substrate happening during the restoration procedures.

{"text":"The use of cover crops (CCs) is a promising cropland management practice with multiple benefits, notably in reducing soil erosion and increasing soil organic carbon (SOC) storage. The historical effect of soil erosion, transport, and deposition on the soil carbon budget at a continental scale in Europe was characterized since the early industrial era, using reconstructed climate and land use forcings. Then, the impact of two distinct policy-oriented scenarios for the introduction of Cover Crops (CC) were evaluated, covering the European cropping systems where surface erosion rates or nitrate susceptibility are critical. The evaluation focused on the increase in SOC storage and the export of particulate organic carbon (POC) to the oceans, compiling a continental-scale carbon budget. The results indicated that Europe exported 1.95 TgC/year of POC to the oceans in the last decade, and that CCs can contribute to reducing this amount while increasing SOC storage. Compared to the simulation without CCs, the additional rate of SOC storage induced by CCs peaked after 10 years of their adoption, followed by a decrease, and the cumulative POC export reduction stabilized after around 13 years. Results show that CC adoption can reduce the annual export while increasing SOC storage. In a scenario of widespread adoption, CCs alone are insufficient to achieve the 4\u2030 target.\nTitle: Soil Organic carbon losses with lateral transfer to the oceans in Europe\nDescription: This group of data incluces: a) The net gains of carbon due to the lateral movements (as in Figure 3a); b) The net losses of carbon due to the lateral movements (as in figure 3b);c) the input of carbon to the non-eroded soil carbon (SC) pool (as in Figure 6a); d) the output of non-eroded SC due to microbial respiration (as in figure 6b); e) Amount of the non-eroded SC that is lost due to erosion (as in figure 6c); f) Gross gains of eroded SC due to the lateral movements (as in figure 6d);g) Gross losses of eroded SC due to the lateral movements (as in figure 6e); and h) Output from the eroded SC due to microbial respiration (as in figure 6f).\nSpatial coverage: EU & UK.Pixel size: 0.125, -0.125 decimal degrees (~10km)Projection: EPSG:4326 - WGS 84Temporal coverage: 2010-2020\u00a0\nReference: Fendrich, A.N., Philippe Ciais, Panagos, P., Martin, P., Carozzi, M., Bertrand Guenet, Emanuele Lugato, 2024.

{"text":"Fourier-Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic analyses were carried out during P adsorption on highly crystalline gibbsite, poorly crystalline 2-line-ferrihydrite and amorphous Fe:Al-hydroxide mixtures in the molar ratio 1:0, 10:1, 1:1, 1:10 and 0:1. The elemental composition of the adsorbents was verified by using SEM-EDX, scanning electron microscopy (DSM 962, Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) with energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (X-Max 50 mm\u00b2 with INCA, Oxford Instruments, Abingdon, Great Britain). The formation of pure Al(OH)3 and FeO(OH) for the amorphous hydroxides was revealed. Determination of the adsorbent crystallization as well as amorphous structures was carried out by X-ray diffraction (XRD) using a PANalytical Empyrean powder diffractometer (Almelo, Netherlands) from GFZ Potsdam, with a theta-theta-goniometer, Cu-K\u03b1 radiation (\u03bb=0.15418 nm), automatic divergent and anti-scatter slits and a PIXcel3D detector. Diffraction data were recorded from 4.6\u00b0 to 84.9\u00b0 2\u03f4 with a step-size of 0.0131 and a step time of 58.4 s. The generator settings were 40 kV and 40 mA. Specific surface areas of all adsorbents were determined with an Autosorb-1 (Quantachrome, Odelzhausen, Germany) using a multi-point BET-measurement (Brunauer-Emmett-Teller) and N2 as adsorptive medium. \nP adsorption was investigated with batch experiments, in which a solid-solution ratio of 1:20 was chosen for gibbsite, and a solid-solution ratio of 1:200 was chosen for ferrihydrite and the Fe:Al-hydroxide mixtures due to their high specific surface areas and P-adsorption capacity. The initial P-concentrations for the adsorption experiments were 150 \u00b5mol l-1, 1000 \u00b5mol l-1 and 2000 \u00b5mol l-1  KH2PO4 for gibbsite and 1000 \u00b5mol l-1, 2000 \u00b5mol l-1 and 5000 \u00b5mol l-1 KH2PO4 for ferrihydrite and the Fe:Al-hydroxides with a 0.01 mol l-1 CaCl2-background electrolyte solution, adjusted to a pH of 6. For P measurements, the gibbsite and ferrihydrite samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 336 \u00d7 G, while the Fe:Al-hydroxide samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 21572 \u00d7 G. The clear supernatant was filtered by using P-poor Whatman 512 1/1 filters. For FT-IR spectroscopic measurements, the remaining solid matter was dried for 24 h at 40\u00b0C, stored overnight in a desiccator and analyzed without further treatment. IR spectroscopic measurements were carried out by measurement of the absorbance in the FT-IR DRIFT mode (Tensor 27 HTS-XT, Bruker, Billerica, USA) with 40 scans per sample, a wavenumber range from 4000 to 400 cm-1, and a resolution of 1.9 cm-1.\n\nResearch domain: Plant Nutrition\n\nResearch question: Which P bindings are formed on the various mineral Fe- and Al-hydroxide surfaces and how do inorganic and organic compounds contribute to the availability of both adsorbed/precipitated and naturally bound phosphorus from phosphate minerals?","id":"9dd3bd40-4ce9-4bda-8642-85415cf3a3ed"}

{"text":"We present a comprehensive, high-quality dataset characterising soil-vegetation and land-surface processes from continuous measurements conducted in two climatically contrasting study regions in South West Germany: the warmer and drier Kraichgau region with a mean temperature of 9.7\u00b0C and annual precipitation of 890 mm, and the cooler and wetter Swabian. Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents. One station in each region has now been set up as continuous observatories of state variables and fluxes in intensively managed agricultural fields.\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences\nThe corresponding publication can be accessed here:\u00a0https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2020-396\u00a0\nDataset version 1.1  This table contains Site 4 soil data.\n\nRelated datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.","id":"a103ae56-152b-4196-99e0-1b9486af0bb7"}
{"text":"The availability of phosphorus (P), strongly influences crop yield and quality. However, due to agricultural practices P accumulated in soil, mostly in inaccessible forms. Bacteria play an important role to mobilize P. The release of P is rather a result of the bacterial need for C and N than the immediate need of P. Thus, we postulated that the addition of carbon and N would stimulate phosphorus mobilization by bacteria. Thus, we performed a metagenomic study to investigate soils from two agricultural sites (Rostock, Freising), which only received mineral N fertilizer or mineral N and organic fertilizer for more than 20 years. The metagenomic sequencing followed by taxonomic and functional annotations of the sequences by blasting against the NCBI-nr database (http://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/ db/FASTA/nr.gz) and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database (June 2011) also revealed that independent of site and season, the relative abundance of genes involved in P turnover was not significantly affected by the addition of fertilizers. However, the type of fertilization had a significant impact on the composition of bacterial families harboring genes coding for the different P transformation processes. This gives rise to the possibility that fertilizers can substantially change phosphorus turnover efficiency by favoring different families. Additionally, none of the families involved in phosphorus turnover covered all investigated processes. Therefore, promoting bacteria which play an essential role specifically in mobilization of hardly accessible phosphorus could help to secure the phosphorus supply of plants in soils with low P input as so far the most abundant genes involved in the acquisition of external P sources in our study were those involved in solubilization and subsequent uptake of inorganic phosphorus. The raw sequencing data is available at the sequencing read archive (SRA) under the BioProject ID PRJNA385596 (SAMN06894543- SAMN06894566). Additionally, we determined dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and carbon (DOC) contents by extracting the soil with 0.01 M CaCl2 solution (soil to liquid ratio: 1:4) and the microbial biomass carbon (Cmic) and nitrogen (Nmic) content by applying a chloroform-fumigation-extraction procedure. Our data indicate that more the site then the treatment changed those values as stability of Cmic, Nmic as well as DOC and DON was high across the different fertilizer regimes. Only additional P fertilization slightly increased DOC values.

The main goal of the sub project was to investigate the effect of agroforestry on evapotranspiration on a system scale. We applied the so called surface energy balance method to calculate half hourly evapotranspiration rates. For that, half hourly evapotranspiration rates were calculated as a residual of the net radiation, the sensible heat flux and the ground heat flux. Besides the latter energy balance components, also standard meteorological data, such as global radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and -direction, air pressure and precipitation were continuously measured since March 2016. All instruments were installed at a 10 m tall weather mast and the data were automatically collected. The weather mast was installed directly at the agroforestry plot of Forst (Lusatia). The agroforestry system in Forst is of a crop land alley cropping type, where poplar tree strips and crop land alternate.

{"text":"The application of fertilizers to soils may impair the quality of both surface and\nsubsurface waters. Severe rainfall events that follow fertilizer application can\nincrease P release from soils. In this study, suction plates were installed in a loamy\nsoil with the aim of determining the P transport patterns and processes in the\nsoil before and after the application of biogas digestate. Prior to the application\nof biogas digestate, the pore water concentrations of dissolved reactive P (DRP)\nwere significantly lower than the total P (TP) concentrations, with DRP/TP ratios\nincreasing from 0.03 to 0.89. After fertilizer application, the TP and DRP pore\nwater concentrations increased 400-fold. The DRP/TP ratio remained almost\nconstant at 0.83. After 220 mm of precipitation, 4.5% of the P mass applied was\nleached to below the 50-cm soil depth, indicating the general mobility of P in\nsoils during high-intensity rainfall. Brilliant Blue dye tracing experiments revealed\nthat organic-matter-rich biogas digestate obviously changes the flow and transport patterns in soils from being homogenous to moderately heterogeneous,\nincluding preferential flow. Although the P loading across the flux plane had\nbeen equilibrated prior to treatment, after the application it was found to be concentrated in preferred transport regions. The emerging conclusion is that the risk\nof ground and subsequent surface water pollution with P after fertilization with\nbiogas digestate originates not only from the applied P mass but also from the\nshift in the flow and transport regime caused by the organic-matter-rich slurry.","id":"a3505f42-b0e3-4fd1-819a-6effaf8c3a3a"}

{"text":"Mitigating the global climate crisis and its consequences, such as more frequent and severe droughts, is one of the major challenges for future agriculture. Therefore, identifying land use systems and management practices that reduce greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) and promote water use efficiency (WUE) is crucial. This however, requires accurate and precise measurements of carbon dioxide (CO2) fluxes and evapotranspiration (ET). Despite that, commercial systems to measure CO2 and ET fluxes are expensive and thus, often exclude research in ecosystems within the Global South. This is especially true for research and data of agroecosystems in these areas, which are to date still widely underrepresented. Here, we present a newly developed, low-cost, non-dispersive infrared (NDIR)-based, CO2 and ET flux measurement device (~ 200 Euro) that provides reliable, accurate and precise CO2 and ET flux measurements in conjunction with manual closed chambers. To validate the system, laboratory and field validation experiments were performed, testing multiple different low-cost sensors. We demonstrate that the system delivers accurate and precise CO2 and ET flux measurements using the K30 FR NDIR (CO2) and SHT31 (RH) sensor. An additional field trial application demonstrated its longer-term stability ( 3 months) and ability to obtain valid net ecosystem C balances (NECB) and WUE. This was the case, even though environmental conditions at the field trial application site in Sub-Saharan Africa were rather challenging (e.g., extremely high temperatures, humidity and intense rainfall). Consequently, the developed low-cost CO2 and ET flux measurement device not only provides reasonable results but might also help to democratize science and close current data gaps.This table contains the index of all tables forming this data collection.\n\nRelated datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.","id":"a3752ecb-c5ea-4f1a-96ff-01a24180d3cb"}

For this reason, we conducted a German-wide online survey among farmers on this topic in autumn/winter 2017/2018. A further aim was to collect information on the dissemination of new technologies (apps) and to identify possible gaps in information services. The quantitative survey was conducted with the software LimeSurvey. Farmers were invited via various channels (professional journals, mailing lists of interest groups, Th\u00fcnen homepage). The questionnaire contained the following thematic blocks: 1. general information on the farm, 2. soil compaction (perception and measures), 3. crop rotation and soil tillage, 4. technical equipment/process organisation (incl. contractors), 5. consulting and information offers (incl. apps). \n\nResearch domain: Agricultural Economics and Sociology","id":"a8151020-b06a-427c-9565-d63236a8787d"}
{"text":"The adaptation of production methods for raw material crops holds a key position in reducing the climate impact of agriculture. This form of utilization is suspected of promoting the CO2 source function through the increased depletion of soil carbon stocks. There is a particular need for action regarding the reduction of negative climate and environmental impacts when applying digestate. Various factors suggest that these problems can be addressed using the well-known technique of partial subsoil tillage. Unlike traditional subsoil tillage, the risk of subsequent yield losses, subsoil compaction, and increased energy expenditures is low here. This is because, in partial subsoil tillage (pST), a controlled mixing of carbon-poor subsoil into the plow layer and the transfer of topsoil into well-rooted shafts in the subsoil are combined. In the topsoil, imbalances in the carbon and nitrogen dynamics are created, which should lead to a rapid rebuild of organic matter stocks and thus to CO2-C sequestration and nitrogen fixation. At the same time, organic carbon located in the subsoil after pST should be protected from rapid decomposition. The overall goal of the project is to determine whether pST actually has the mentioned effects and whether it can be optimized through an interdisciplinary research approach to achieve a lasting reduction in the climate and environmental impact of raw material crop production in agricultural practice.","id":"a819e109-67c3-4d85-8575-dd7132363540"}
{"text":"The dataset contains two kinds of wind-related-data for the site Forst (Lower Lusatia) in the SIGNAL project:\n1. Columns (1-5) contain the information on the sampling point location \n2. Columns (6-8) are the relative wind speed which is the ratio between wind speed inside the agroforestry system relative to the open field without trees (monoculture). The relative wind speed was simulated with the Large Eddy Simulation model ASAM (All Scale Atmospheric Model, J\u00e4hn et al. (2015). The relative wind speed was calculated for three different wind directions (N, NW, W), for a tree height of 5 m and at a height of 0.5 m above ground.\n3. Columns (9-11) contain the number of days with potential erosion risk for the reference and agroforestry site. These columns are a combination of measured wind speed data at the Forst monoculture site and the modeled LES data (column 6-8). Potential erosion risk in this dataset is defined as wind speeds above 5m/s at 0.5m height above the ground. In total, the dataset contained 742 days of at least one 30 min maximum wind speed measurement.\n\nCalculating the potential erosion risk at 0.5m height:\nstep 1. Erosion risk at the monoculture site\nThe maximum wind speeds at the monoculture site were measured at 3.5m height. By assuming a logarithmic wind profile the 30min maximum wind speeds were converted into maximum wind speeds at 0.5m height. A maximum wind speed larger 5m/s per day is considered as potential erosion risk. The number of days with potential erosion risk was summed.\nstep 2. Erosion risk at the agroforestry site\nThe maximum wind speeds from step 1 were multiplied by the relative wind speeds obtained from the LES model for the different wind directions. This results in spatially distributed maximum wind speeds inside the agroforestry system. Each wind speed above 5m/s, is considered as a potential erosion risk event. A maximum wind speed larger 5m/s per day is considered as potential erosion risk. The number of days with potential erosion risk was summed for each measurement point. \n\nDataset version 1.0","id":"a95fd45d-d51b-4698-830d-44f38d7a7340"}

{"text":"Erosion-induced topsoil dilution strongly affects cropland biogeochemistry and is associated with a negative effect on soil health and crop productivity. While its impact on soil C cycling has been widely recognized, there are few information about its impact on soil N cycling and N fertilizer dynamics. Here, we studied three factors potentially influencing N cycling and N fertilizer dynamics in cropping systems, namely: 1.) soil type, 2.) erosion-induced topsoil dilution and 3.) N fertilizer form in a full-factorial pot experiment using canola plants. We studied three erosion affected soil types (Luvisol, eroded Luvisol, calcaric Regosol) and performed topsoil dilution in all three soils by admixing 20% of the respective subsoil into its topsoil. N fertilizer dynamics was investigated using either mineral (calcium ammonium nitrate) and organic (biogas digestate) fertilizer, labeled with 15N. The fertilizer 15N recovery and the distribution of the fertilizer N in different soil fractions was quantified after plant maturity. Fertilizer N dynamics and utilization were influenced by all three factors investigated. 15N recovery in the plant-soil system was higher and fertilizer N utilization was lower in the treatments with diluted topsoil than in the non-diluted controls. Similarly, plants of the organic fertilizer N treatments took up significantly less fertilizer N in comparison to mineral fertilizer treatments. Both, topsoil dilution and organic fertilizer application promoted 15N recovery and N accumulation in the soil fractions, with strong differences between soil types. Our study reveals a noteworthy insight: topsoil dilution due to soil erosion has a negligible impact on N cycling and dynamics in the plant-soil system. The crucial factors influencing these processes are found to be the choice of fertilizer form and the specific soil type. Recognizing these aspects is essential for a precise and comprehensive assessment of the environmental continuum, emphasizing the novelty of our findings.

{"text":"Abstract: The data set contains daily time-step observed and scenario climate data on a European grid with 25 km x 25 km spatial resolution and is intended to be used for crop modelling applications. The dataset covers the period 1980-2010 for observations (for a baseline period of 1981-2010 and the year 1980 for crop model simulations with sowing dates in the autumn) and the periods 2040-2069 and 2070-2099 for 5 GCMs x 2 forcing scenarios (RCP4.5 and RCP8.5) and 2 GCMs with RCP2.6. The Joint Research Centre\u2019s (JRC) Agri4Cast gridded dataset was used for the baseline. The scenarios have been calculated using an enhanced delta change method that applies changes in aspects of temperature and precipitation variability in addition to changes in mean climate.\n\nMethods: The structure of the single tables refers to the gridcode of the model, for example the gridcode 35120 fits the location 35_120. This means the gridcode column is 120, the row 35. The explanation can be found in the properties of the kml file or the associated grid file. The dataset was generated by applying a \u201cdelta change factor\u201d based on GCM outputs for RCP scenarios corresponding to the periods: 2040 until 2069 and from 2070 until 2099. As the \u201cdelta change factor\u201d for these periods was applied to baseline observations for the period of 1.1.1980 to 31.12.2010, the dates for the respective scenario periods are still 1.1.1980 to 31.12.2010, due to the fact they are scenarios (ie, what would climate be relative to baseline climate). Pragmatically this avoids issues with different alignment of leap years between baseline and scenario periods. This is standard practice in climate data. Users of the data can adjust the dates as needed for their application.\n\nSeries Information: Version 3 (DOI: https://www.doi.org/10.4228/zalf.vjcp-vep3; consisting of 9220 grid cells) replaces two earlier versions by updating the method to estimate vapour pressure and dew point temperature and by expanding the study region to include Switzerland, Lichtenstein, the Balkan region and Kaliningrad.

Each field plot of 27 m\u00b2 was replicated four times in a split-plot design. Treatment samples were taken in W1 and W3 plots of the cultivar \u201cNordkap\u201d of the optimal N-level plots (240 kg N/ha). The crop rotational trial in Harste was established 2006 and included eight crop rotations, out of which two with winter wheat were included in this study, (1) a wheat monoculture and (2) a winter oilseed rape - winter wheat \u2013 winter wheat \u2013 grain pea \u2013 sugar beet \u2013 winter wheat rotation. Each crop rotational element is cultivated every year, which allowed us to sample three different crop rotational positions of winter wheat simultaneously per year. In Harste treatment samples were taken from the first wheat after winter oilseed rape grown as break crop (W1), from the second wheat after winter oilseed rape grown as break crop (W2), and from the long-term wheat monoculture (WM). Each plot of 110 m\u00b2 was replicated three times within a split-plot design containing incomplete blocks.\nFor each replicate, 9 -12 soil cores (0-30 cm depth), sampled randomly across the respective total field plot area, were combined. Soil samples were sieved (4 mm mesh-size) and all samples were split among project partners for enzymology testing, fungal microbiome and prokaryotic microbiome analyses. For the root-associated samples 9-12 wheat plants were picked per treatment (wheat rotational positions) across the field plot area and combined (composite sample). Samples were taken in 2020 at the plant developmental stages flowering (BBCH 59-65) and early ripening (BBCH 69-75) and in 2021 in addition at the end of tillering (BBCH 30). Root-associated samples were split at the field sites into the rhizosphere fraction by brushing off the soil particles from roots using sterile disposable toothbrushes and wearing gloves at all times.

{"text":"This data set was created in the frame of the project Soil3 - Sustainable Subsoil Management, which aims at optimizing the utilization of the soil volume for plant growth. The aim was to reveal the effects of 34 years of legumes (crimson clover, fava beans) and non-legumes (maize) in rotation combined with different fertilization regimes (no fertilization, PK fertilization, NPK fertilization) on soil potassium (K) storage throughout the uppermost meter of the soil profile. Calcium acetate lactate-extractable potassium (KCAL), considered as a proxy for plant-available K in German soils, was measured according to Sch\u00fcller (1969). Both in topsoil and in 30-50 cm depth, full fertilization increased plant-available K density significantly, although PK fertilized plots were not statistically distinct from the other fertilization regimes. Below 50 cm, neither K concentrations nor K densities were affected by management.\n\nResearch category: Plant Nutrition\nResearch Question: Arable subsoil can act as an insurance system for crops in terms of water and nutrient supply.

{"text":"The data set was provided by the responsible parties of the SIGNAL sub project \u201cEvaporation and transpiration of agroforestry\u201d. The objective of the sub project was to investigate the effect of agroforestry on evapotranspiration on a whole system scale. We applied the so called surface energy balance method to calculate half hourly evapotranspiration rates. Half hourly evapotranspiration rates were calculated as a residual of the net radiation, the sensible heat flux and the ground heat flux. Besides the latter energy balance components, also standard meteorological data, such as global radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and -direction and precipitation were continuously measured since April 2016. All instruments were installed at a 3.5 m tall weather mast and the data were automatically collected. The weather mast was installed at the reference plot of Wendhausen.

{"text":"We present a comprehensive, high-quality dataset characterising soil-vegetation and land-surface processes from continuous measurements conducted in two climatically contrasting study regions in South West Germany: the warmer and drier Kraichgau region with a mean temperature of 9.7\u00b0C and annual precipitation of 890 mm, and the cooler and wetter Swabian. Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents. One station in each region has now been set up as continuous observatories of state variables and fluxes in intensively managed agricultural fields.\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences\nThe corresponding publication can be accessed here:\u00a0https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2020-396\u00a0\nDataset version 1.1 \n This table contains data on observations of plants.\n\nRelated datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.","id":"bd42cf1a-9747-4c8a-9a51-e42ae46950da"}

The average annual rainfall over 20 years is 1820 mm with a bimodal distribution and the mean daily temperature is 23.5o C. The soils are Ferric Acrisols characterized by a low base saturation and a low cation exchange capacity. At the site the soils are highly acidic, with pH (1:1 H2O) between 3.5 and 4.5. These soils are dominated by kaolinites and sesquioxydes, which cause cation exchange capacity to be low in such soils. Replenishment from other sources is crucial for proper plant/crop growth. The vegetation consists of secondary humid forest.   \nA population consisting of Recombinant Inbred Lines (F11; RILs) derived from a cross between the contrasting cowpea genotypes Yacine and 58-77 were used in the study. These RILs were developed in the Senegalese Agricultural Research Institute (ISRA) through inbreeding and single Seed descent. 58-77 is a black small-seeded local cultivar from Senegal resistant to pest and diseases with good nodulation and nitrogen fixation properties while Yacine is also a variety developed in Senegal that has large brown seeds, and very poor nodulation and low nitrogen fixation potentials. The seeds are available at the Senegalese Agricultural Research Institute (ISRA) and can be genotyped and combined with this phenotypic data for QTL mapping. The evaluation was done on low Nitrogen plots. The low N plots were created by planting maize at very high densities (100,000 plants /ha) for two seasons. The soil rhizobia population was found to be high (103 rhizobium bacteria per g soil) and inoculation unnecessary. The experimental design was a split-plot with two replicates. The main plots was two phosphate levels: 0 P and 30 Kg P ha-1 (Triple super phosphate (TSP)), while the RILs and two parents constituted the sub-plots randomized in a 12 x 10 \u03b1-lattice design.

{"text":"In recent years, agricultural machinery became steadily larger and heavier. Especially under wet soil conditions, when soil is susceptible to compaction, heavy wheel load field traffic can lead to harmful soil compaction. This data set contains soil data from a wheeling experiment with agricultural vehicles from the silage maize harvest chain (maize chopper (total weight: 20 t), tractor with mulcher (total weight: 75 t), and tractor with silage trailer (total weight: 32 t)). The experiment was conducted in 2016 on an agricultural test field in Adenstedt (Hildesheim district, Lower Saxony, Germany). The soil type is Stagnic Luvisol derived from Loess and was tilled with a cultivator up to a depth of 25 cm (reduced tillage). For the wheeling experiment, the harvest chain vehicles passed defined plots in the inner field area one after another (8 wheel passes). Maximum soil pressure und plastic soil deformation evoked by vehicle passing was measured simultaneously with a multi-channel device consisting of Bolling probes (Bolling, 1987) and hydrostatic measuring hoses (Nolting et al., 2006). Maximum soil pressure and plastic soil deformation was measured in 20, 35, and 50 cm depth directly below the center of the tires. To investigate changes in soil physical parameters, soil structure, and soil functions caused by harvest chain vehicles driving, undisturbed soil cores (100 cm\u00b3) were taken before (unwheeled) and after wheeling (wheeled). The sampling sites were located in the inner field area. Two soil pits were sampled per wheeling variant. A total of 30 undisturbed soil samples were taken per each soil pit, 10 per each soil depth (20, 35, 50 cm). The soil biopores were counted in every one of the three soil depths. 5 of the 10 undisturbed sampling rings were used to investigate soil water retention and the other 5 for saturated hydraulic conductivity. The determination of pF values was conducted in the soil laboratory using sand and clay boxes as well as pressure pots according to DIN ISO 11274. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was analyzed using a soil water permeameter (open system) according to ISO / FDIS 17312. The soil parameters total pore volume, air capacity, field capacity, usable field capacity, permanent wilting point, dry bulk density, and current water content during soil sampling were derived from the soil laboratory results.\n\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences","id":"c0096e15-df0d-4ba9-9b46-bafa414cd14b"}

{"text":"In order to support sustainable soil management, an exchange between scientists and other soil-related stakeholders is crucial. Previously, an overview on the soil-related stakeholders in Germany was published at the national level (https://doi.org/10.13039/501100002347). This database is further overview of the soil-related stakeholders, though, at the German federal state level (in German). \nThe three listed-below stakeholder groups, which were assumed to have a direct or indirect influence on soil functions, were initially derived from the drivers of soil management (i.e. socio\u2010economic, biophysical, and technology). The groups were defined such as (1) state authorities, (2) civil societies, and (3) agricultural associations. The stakeholders\u2019 influence/power and interest were evaluated with the focus of organizations on the five main soil functions, i.e. production, water purification, carbon sequestration, biodiversity, recycling of nutrients and chemicals. \nThe level of the influence/power and interest was estimated in a relative matter among the stakeholders by taking into account such parameters as the number of members/partners/employees, the visibility of organizations (via projects, products, policies, press, publications etc.) as well as the hierarchy among the state organizations. The level of awareness of stakeholders\u2019 activities was also used in assessing the stakeholders\u2019 influence.\n\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences\n\nResearch question: The aim was to create a stakeholder database, representing soil-related stakeholders across Germany at the federal state scale.","id":"c5161b5e-8286-4c6e-8ad6-fde35a706c9d"}
{"text":"The dataset reports the contingency table of AMF sequence variants, their associated DNA sequence, accession number, and taxonomy. AMF come from soil or root samples from a two growing-season mesocosm experiment mimicking a crop rotation, with a first phase growing AM or non-AM and/or rhizobial or non rhizobial precrops followed with an AM crop. During the second phase, organic fertilization was applied (saw dust or wheat straw). The aim is to test the effect of precrop plant symbiotic functional group on following crop AM fungal diversity and abundance. Four crop plant species were used to have a combination of all symbiotic groups: spring canola (Brassica napus cv. Medicus, NPZ, non-rhizobial / non-AM), withe lupine (Lupinus albus cv. Energy, Feldsaaten Freudenberger, rhizobial / non-AM),  spring barley (Hordeum vulgare cv. Barke, Saatzucht Breun, non rhizobial/AM) faba bean (Vicia faba cv. Tiffany, NPZ, rhizobial / AM). The succeeding crop was winter barley (Hordeum vulgare, cv. Antonella, Nordsaat Saatzucht, non-rhizobial / AM). The AMF community structure was analyzed by amplicon sequencing of the D1-D2 region of the fungal LSU (28S) rRNA gene using the primers LR2rev (5'-GAAAAGAACTTTGAAAA-3') and LR3 (5'-CCGTGTTTCAAGACG-3'). The taxonomy and sequence for each sequence variant is included. The sequences were generated using the primers LR2rev (5'-GAAAAGAACTTTGAAAA-3') and LR3 (5'-CCGTGTTTCAAGACG-3'). The results revealed that the mycorrhizal precrop symbiotic group (AM or not AM), but not the rhizobial one (N2-fixer or not N2-fixer), affected the richness and composition of AM fungi in the soil. The effect on composition, but not on richness, persisted in the following crop, demonstrating a legacy effect of precrop functional group. However, this effect was weaker than that of contemporary factors such as nutrient addition. AMF community composition correlated to decreasing crop yield after AM precrops. Phylogenetic analyses revealed that differences in AMF communities pertained at deep phylogenetic levels. These findings suggest negative plant-soil feedbacks within the AM symbiosis in agro-ecosystems typical of western Europe, driven by the consistent selection of deep clades of AM fungi.

{"text":"During June and July of 2017, wild bees were collected using color traps (blue, yellow and white pans) in small water bodies called kettle holes embedded in agricultural landscapes in the north of Germany. After all wild bees were identified to species level, from a subset of samples we measured the Intertegular distance ITD (distance between the wings) as body size and searched for functional traits regarding sociality (solitary, eusocial, parasitic) nesting type (below- or aboveground), and lecty (poly- or oligolectic). In addition, biotic and abiotic characteristics of these kettle holes were recorded to evaluate how they affect wild bee diversity. These factors included size of the kettle hole, the degree of isolation (number of neighboring kettle holes at different distances), percentage of flowering species and total of plant species (herbs and woody plants). We tested the effect of all these factors on wild bee abundance and bee species richness, as well on body size and functional traits.\n-\nApplied Methods for sampling and identification:\nCollection of individuals using colour traps. One trap had 6 coloured plastic containers (white, blue and yellow) placed in three levels randomly. Water with some drops of soap was added to each container and traps were place in each kettle hole during 48 hours. A total of 4 traps were set up in each kettle hole and a total of 36 kettle holes were studied. After 2 days insects trapped in the water were collected without differentiating the colour of the plastic container. Bee individuals were separated and taken to the lab for further preparation and identification.\n-\nBee specimens were pinned and dried at room temperature. Individuals were identified until species level by specialists K. Rupik from Bielefeld University and C. Saure at the Natural History Museum in Berlin.

{"text":"Between 2017 and 2019 we studied the abundance of spider mites in the soil to estimate the potential infestation pressure of soil colonizing spider mites. The spider mites were heterogeneously distributed in small concentrations in the soil. Soil colonizing spider mites did not affect spider mite abundance on plants and reversed. We observed that spider mite migration occurred primarily from the edge of the field adjacent to the weed strip. In 2020 and 2021, we investigated the efficacy of the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) for suppressing spider mite hotspots in the cropland. We compared untreated spider mite hotspots with N. californicus treated hotspots and showed that a single release of predatory mites could result in a high level of control when spider mite infestation density was initially high. With this study, soil can be ruled out as a habitat for spider mites, and attention to spider mite pest control can be directed to plant infestations. The highly sensitive HRM real-time PCR assay was used for the quantification of the spider mites. Tetranychus urticae served as reference. Research domain: Soil Sciences Research question: Does the soil serve as a shelter for spider mites and must the soil be included in control strategies? Does invasive infestation by spider mites occur on crops starting from the soil?

{"text":"In recent years, agricultural machinery became steadily larger and heavier. Especially under wet soil conditions, when soil is susceptible to compaction, heavy wheel load field traffic can lead to harmful soil compaction. This data set contains soil data from a wheeling experiment with an agricultural vehicle (2-axle combine harvester with bunker; total weight: 17 t). The experiment was conducted in 2016 on an agricultural test field in Adenstedt (Hildesheim district, Lower Saxony, Germany) during the harvest campaign. The soil type is Stagnic Luvisol derived from Loess and was conventionally tilled with a plough up to a depth of 28 cm. The cultivated crop was winter wheat. For the wheeling experiment, a combine harvester with full bunker volume passed defined plots in the field. In the inner field area, the number of wheel passes were 2 and in the headlands the number of wheel passes were 6. The sampling sites were both located in the inner field area and in the headlands. To investigate changes in soil physical parameters, soil structure, and soil functions caused by combine harvester driving, undisturbed soil cores (100 cm\u00b3) were taken before (unwheeled) and after wheeling (wheeled). The unwheeled soil samples were taken in 22, 35, and 50 depth and the wheeled soil samples in 20, 35, and 50 cm depth. In the inner field area, two soil pits were sampled per wheeling variant and in the headlands, one soil pit was sampled per wheeling variant. Additionally, the soil biopores were counted in every one of the three soil depths. A total of 30 undisturbed soil samples were taken per each soil pit, 10 per each soil depth.5 of the 10 undisturbed sampling rings were used to investigate soil water retention and the other 5 for saturated hydraulic conductivity. The determination of pF values was conducted in the soil laboratory using sand and clay boxes as well as pressure pots according to DIN ISO 11274. Saturated hydraulic conductivity was analyzed using a soil water permeameter (open system) according to ISO / FDIS 17312. The soil parameters total pore volume, air capacity, field capacity, usable field capacity, permanent wilting point, dry bulk density, and current water content during soil sampling were derived from the soil laboratory results.\n\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences","id":"d1cdbca9-3f3e-4995-a79e-b5b464e97b04"}

{"text":"To create a holistic data set for the verification of sugar beet yield models, a time series field experiment was set up in 1972 in Bad Lauchst\u00e4dt (Germany), a location in the Hallensian B\u00f6rde Plateau with loess soils up to 1,5 m depth, which is predestined for sugar beet cultivation. The soil is divided into horizons as follows: Arable topsoil (up to 25 cm depth), humic lime-free horizon (up to 40 cm depth), calcareous mixed horizon (up to 60 cm depth) and calcareous loess (up to 125 cm depth). In a block design experiment with four replicates, the test factors irrigation with two levels and fertilization with three levels were studied. Intensive holistic data collection on the most important plant and soil parameters was carried out at weekly intervals until final harvest at the end of September. In the case of sugar beet plant, the fresh and dry biomasses of the leaf and the body and some plant contents such as nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium and sodium contents as well as sugar and ash contents were measured or determined. In addition some  ontogenesis and stand density parameters were observed. Soil parameters such as nitrogen, soil water, pH as well as phosphorus, potassium, magnesium and sodium contents were measured for two 25 cm soil layers up to a soil depth of 0.5 m.

{"text":"Apple replant disease (ARD) is a soil-borne disease, which is of particular importance for fruit tree nurseries and fruit growers. The disease manifests by a poor vegetative development, stunted growth and reduced yield in terms of quantity and quality, if apple plants (usually rootstocks) are replanted several times at the same site. Genotype-specific differences in the reaction of apple plants to ARD are documented, but less is known about the genetic mechanisms behind this symptomatology. Recent transcriptome analyses resulted in a number of candidate genes possibly involved in the plant response. In the present study, the expression of 108 selected candidate genes was investigated in root and leaf tissue of four different apple genotypes grown in untreated ARD soil and ARD soil disinfected by \u03b3-irradiation originating from two different sites in Germany. Thirty-nine out of the 108 candidate genes were differentially expressed in roots by taking a p-value of  0.05 and a fold change of  1.5 as cutoff. Sixteen genes were more than 4.5-fold upregulated in roots of plants grown in ARD soil. The four genes MNL2 (putative mannosidase), ALF5 (multi antimicrobial extrusion protein), UGT73B4 (UDP-glycosyltransferase 73B4) and ECHI (chitin-binding) were significantly upregulated in roots. These genes seem to be related to the host plant response to ARD, although they have never been described in this context before. Six of the highly upregulated genes belong to the phytoalexin biosynthesis pathway. Their genotype-specific gene expression pattern was consistent with the phytoalexin content measured in roots. The biphenyl synthase (BIS) genes were found to be useful as early biomarkers for ARD, because their expression pattern correlated well with the phenotypic reaction of the Malus genotypes investigated.\n\nThe presented data contain growth records from the greenhouse biotest of the Malus genotypes M26, M9, B63 and Malus x robusta MAL0595 potted into untreated of disinfected soil from the ARD sites Heidgraben and Meckenheim. Shoot length was recorded weekly and after four weeks, fresh and dry masses of the shoots and roots were measured. Single plants were pooled for gene expression and phytoalexin analysis. The use and pooling of each individual plant can be traced back within the dataset. \n\nThe experiment is summarized in Reim et al.

{"text":"Soil erosion affects 20% of croplands. However, our understanding of the effect that soil erosion might have on emissions of N2O, which is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, is still limited. This limitation is likely because the small-scale differences in soil properties and fertility induced by erosion (i.e. ranges of erosion states) have barely been considered in studies quantifying N2O emissions from croplands. There are, however, indications that the erosion state itself strongly impacts N2O fluxes, similar to the N fertilizer form. Therefore, our investigations aimed to further explore these indications. The soil and erosion stages of the study area are classified as Albic Luvisols (LVa; non-eroded dry soil), Calcaric Regosol (RGca; extremely eroded dry soil) and Endogleyic Colluvic Regosols (RGco; wet colluvial soil in a depression). \n\n\nThis datasets contains data of soil data, N2O flux obtained from the measurements that were conducted from 03/05/2010 to 03/05/2013 within the hummocky ground moraine landscape of northeastern Germany (CarboZALF-D), modelled N2O flux and Nmin data.

Winter rye plants grown in a long-time field trial (Thy_ABS; 52\u00b015\u2019 N, 13\u00b014\u2019 E, 44 m a.s.l.)  under conventional or organic farming practices were inoculated after plant emergence in autumn 2020 with a beneficial microbial consortium containing Pseudomonas sp. (RU47, drench inoculation with 2 L per m\u00b2 of 7.5 x 107 CFU mL-1), Bacillus atrophaeus (ABi03, drench inoculation with 2 L per m\u00b2 of 7.5 x 107 CFU mL-1) and Trichoderma harzianum (OMG16, soil inoculation with 100 mg inoculum per m\u00b2). The density of the microbial inoculants in the rhizosphere and root-associated soil as well as the plant performance and nutrient status was quantified in autumn and the following spring. Selective plating demonstrated that the beneficial microbes successfully colonized the rhizosphere and root-associated soil of winter rye throughout its early growth cycle. The inoculation with a beneficial microbial consortium enhanced the biomass of winter rye, especially under organic farming practices at the second sampling in spring. The consortium significantly improved the nutrient status of the winter rye plants, providing an effective way to overcome nutrient limitations often found in organic farming.\n\nResearch domain: Plant Cultivation and Agricultural Technology\n\nResearch question: We hypothesized that (i) early inoculation of winter rye enables sufficient colonization of each BMc member at\nearly plant developmental stage, supporting its persistence in the rhizosphere throughout the vegetation period; (ii) the application of BMc shapes the composition of the rhizosphere bacterial community depending on the farming practice and thus differentially affects the plant performance.","id":"d841a5fd-a161-473a-a851-8d2b34702f8b"}

{"text":"Plant litter decomposition is an important process to restore carbon and other nutrients in soil. A large variety of bacterial species are involved in early phases of the litter decomposition. However, the impact of reduced soil and leaf bacterial diversity on the initial litter decomposition process is poorly understood. Thus, we performed a litter decomposition experiment under controlled conditions. We compared maize leaf litter decomposition rates in soils with different levels of bacterial diversity, prepared from one natural soil (NS) by manipulating its bacterial diversity. Autoclaving and reinoculation with an extract of microbes from NS eliminated parts of the \u201crare biosphere\u201d. This approach substantially reduced bacterial diversity in autoclaved soil (AS) and inoculated soil (IS) compared to NS, while no significant differences in bacterial abundance were determined among the soil treatments after a preincubation period (Week \u22122 to 0). Natural and autoclaved maize leaves were applied to the soil treatments and incubated for 6 weeks. Bacterial diversity and community composition were assessed on Week \u22122, 0, and 6 using 16S rRNA gene metabarcoding. Bacterial and fungal abundance were assessed based on the copy number of the 16S rRNA gene and the ITS regions. Litter decomposition rates were assessed by calculating the quotient of remaining and initial litter amounts (dry weight basis). Due to the very small amount of litter materials left in litterbags on week 6, further molecular analysis was performed only on the maize samples collected on week 0. Our data suggested a positive correlation between litter decomposition rates and soil bacterial diversity. The soil with the highest bacterial diversity was dominated by oligotrophic bacteria including Acidobacteria, Nitrospiraceae, and Gaiellaceae, and its community composition did not change during the incubation. In the less diverse soils, oligotrophic bacteria were absent, but were replaced by copiotrophic bacteria such as Caulobacteraceae and Beijerinckiaceae, until the end of the incubation period. SourceTracker analysis revealed that litter-associated bacteria such as Beijerinckiaceae only became part of the bacterial communities in the less diverse soils. This suggests a pivotal role of oligotrophic bacteria during the early phases of litter decomposition and the predominance of copiotrophic bacteria at low diversity.

The samples have been centrifuged for 15 min at 3500 rpm and the clear supernatant was filtrated by using P-poor Whatmann 512 \u00bd filters. The concentrations of P and Fe were determined using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy (ICP-AES). \nUnder real conditions in the soil, an influence of the P sorption on the pH is to be expected. Therefore, the pH change was taken into account both at the beginning and at the end of the adsorption experiments. The pH change was measured in a reference experiment that was treated exactly under the same conditions as P adsorption experiment. The amount of adsorbed P was referred to both the initial and the final pH.\nFor FT-IR spectroscopic measurements, the solid goethite samples after an adsorption time of 2 and 168 h were dried for 24 h at 40\u00b0C, and stored in a desiccator. The samples were analyzed without further treatment prior to FT-IR measurements. IR spectroscopic analyses were carried out by measurement of the absorbance in the FT-IR Drift mode (Tensor 27 HTS-XT, Bruker) and a wavenumber range from 400 to 4000 cm-1. The spectrum of each treatment was created by generate the average of the 2 replicated samples by using the software Essential FTIR\u00ae (Operant LLC), where each sample included 40 scans. For evaluation, all spectra together were truncated in the range 1300 to 800 cm-1, baseline corrected, and normalized with respect to the highest absorbance.\nAfter 2 h adsorption time, the amount of adsorbed P was 0.52 \u00b5mol m-2 at pH 4, 0.65 \u00b5mol m-2 for pH 6, 0.58 \u00b5mol m-2 for pH 8, 0.29 \u00b5mol m-2 for pH 10, and 0.14 \u00b5mol m-2 for pH 12. Considering the initial pH, P adsorption on goethite after an adsorption time of 168 h was highest for pH 8, yielding a P surface coverage of 0.75 \u00b5mol m-2 after a reaction time of 168 h, followed by pH 6 with 0.72 \u00b5mol m-2, and pH 4 with 0.68 \u00b5mol m-2. The extent of adsorption decreased from pH 8 to 10 with 0.58 \u00b5mol m-2 and was lowest for pH 12 with 0.18 \u00b5mol m-2. The solution pH decreased for the initial pH 4 to 3.9., and for the initial pH of 6, the final pH was 5.0. For initial pH values 8.0 and 10.0, the corresponding final pH values were 6.7 and 7.6, respectively. At initial pH 12.0, the decrease of the solution pH weakened with a final pH of 11.6.\n\n\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences\n\nResearch question: How does the solution-pH affect the amount and binding motiv of adsorbed phosphorus on the goethite surface?","id":"e2d7a740-8c6e-4fc1-92db-21bf6d95cd0d"}

{"text":"Soil erosion affects 20% of croplands. However, our understanding of the effect that soil erosion might have on emissions of N2O, which is one of the most potent greenhouse gases, is still limited. This limitation is likely because the small-scale differences in soil properties and fertility induced by erosion (i.e. ranges of erosion states) have barely been considered in studies quantifying N2O emissions from croplands. There are, however, indications that the erosion state itself strongly impacts N2O fluxes, similar to the N fertilizer form. Therefore, our investigations aimed to further explore these indications.

Each SFT is described by a multivariate soil parameter distribution along its depth profile. The agglomerated simplicity of the 3D multivariate soil parameter space into a limited number of spatially allocated process units provides the basis to run agricultural process models at national scale (Germany). \nThe data product refers to the parameter space until a depth of 1 m. It has a 100 m raster resolution in the 2D mapping space, and its resolution along the depth profile is 1 cm.

It can be assumed that different varieties have different tendencies to interact with the microbiome. The aim is therefore to gain insights into whether the choice of variety at a location allows a statement to be made about the mycorrhizal tendency and whether this consequently influences the phosphorus nutrient status in the soil and plant.

{"text":"Societal demands on soil functionality in agricultural soil-landscapes are confronted with yield losses and environmental impact. Soil functional information at national scale is required to address these challenges. Following the rationale that similarity in soils is reflected by similarity in landscape characteristics, soil functional types (SFTs) were defined and projected into space by machine learning. Each SFT is described by a multivariate soil parameter distribution along its depth profile. The agglomerated simplicity of the 3D multivariate soil parameter space into a limited number of spatially allocated process units provides the basis to run agricultural process models at national scale (Germany). \nThe data product refers to the parameter space until a depth of 1 m. It has a 100 m raster resolution in the 2D mapping space, and its resolution along the depth profile is 1 cm. It includes the soil properties: horizon occurrence probability of the organic horizon (symbol_H), the horizon with stagnic properties (symbol_S), groundwater influence (symbol G), and the C horizon (symbol_C), the depth limitation by bedrock (symbol_mC) as well as the soil properties texture (sand_content,  silt_content,  clay_content), stone content, and bulk density.\nThe data product consists of three files: A nationwide raster (SFT.tif) indicating the spatial allocation of the SFTs in terms of an identifier variable, and two related tables (MSPD1.csv and MSPD2.csv) including the information of the multivariate parameter distributions of the SFTs.

{"text":"Associations of plants species having contrasted root architecture can have a beneficial impact on the overall crop productivity. However, combining multiple plants species into a single crop creates practical challenges for the farmer. Another more practical solution is to combine cultivars of a same species with contrasted root systems. For instance, combining deep and shallow root systems may provide multiple advantages creating a more resilient and durable agro-ecosystem against water deficit. In the CROP project (Combining ROot contrasted Phenotypes for more resilient agro-ecosystem, funded by the German BMBF), we will focus on the plant species winter wheat (Triticum aestivum) for its economic importance and its susceptibility to future climate modifications. We evaluate if the two cultivars, UPQ12 and UPQ15 (developed at Hickey lab, University of Queensland, Australia; see for details (Rambla et al., 2022)), having different root insertion angle values (110 and 66\u00b0, respectively), lead to shallower and deeper root systems, respectively. These cultivars were obtained from the Hickey lab (University of Queensland, Australia).\nThese two contrasted wheat root cultivars are studied in this experiment. Thirteen PVC columns (diameter = 8 cm, height = 45cm) were filled with silty loam soil from one testing site of the Research Center Julich, located in Selhausen (50.8659 N, 6.4471 E). The columns received two seeds each and were afterwards installed in a climate chamber (20\u00b0C day, 18\u00b0C night, 50% RH, 1000 \u03bcmol m\u22122s\u22121 of PAR from 6am to 8pm). The mean initial soil gravimetric water content (\u03b8soil) was of 0.40 cm3 cm\u22123. Water was added twice a week to keep the \u03b8soil value between 0.30 cm3 cm\u22123 to 0.44 cm3 cm\u22123. Fertiliser (7% Nitrate, 19% Ammonium) was added at 6 and 34 days after sowing (stage two leaves and tillering, respectively) in liquid solution supplied at a rate of 3 kg m\u22122. At 28, 35, 42 and 49 Days after Sowing three of the soil columns were randomly selected to extract the root systems from the soil columns segmented in 5 layers of 9cm. Soil samples from each layers were sampled and stored in a freezer at \u221220\u25e6C. Shoot parts of the plant growing on these columns were also sampled at the same time. After sampling, stems and leaves were stored in a freezer at \u221220\u25e6C The roots were then stored in 30% Ethanol solutions to be scanned (Expression 10000XL Model J181A; EPSON, Japan).

{"text":"Between 2017 and 2019 we studied the abundance of spider mites in the soil to estimate the potential infestation pressure of soil colonizing spider mites. The spider mites were heterogeneously distributed in small concentrations in the soil. Soil colonizing spider mites did not affect spider mite abundance on plants and reversed. We observed that spider mite migration occurred primarily from the edge of the field adjacent to the weed strip. In 2020 and 2021, we investigated the efficacy of the predatory mite Neoseiulus californicus (McGregor) for suppressing spider mite hotspots in the cropland. We compared untreated spider mite hotspots with N. californicus treated hotspots and showed that a single release of predatory mites could result in a high level of control when spider mite infestation density was initially high. With this study, soil can be ruled out as a habitat for spider mites, and attention to spider mite pest control can be directed to plant infestations. The highly sensitive HRM real-time PCR assay was used for the quantification of the spider mites. Tetranychus urticae served as reference. Research domain: Soil Sciences Research question: Does the soil serve as a shelter for spider mites and must the soil be included in control strategies? Does invasive infestation by spider mites occur on crops starting from the soil? Can the targeted use of predatory mites contain spider mite hotspots?\ntable KERSTEN_ET_AL_DATA_FIG6:\nEffect of predatory mites on spider mite hotspots in cucumber cultivation in 2020 and 2021. Soil and leaf samples from spider mite hotspots located in cucumber fields were analysed weekly for three weeks during main cucumber harvest (first sampling time: T0; second sampling time: T1; third sampling time: T2). Untreated control spider mite hotspots (- predatory mites) were compared with hotspots where predatory mites were released (+ predatory mites). Predatory mites (N. californicus) were applied between T0 and T1. The control hotspots (-predatory mites) were therefore also colonized with spider mites and represented the natural infestation process without countermeasures. Predatory mites show a reducing effect on spider mites in the hotspot only when the initial level of spider mite colonization is high. Spider mites were detected by HRM real-time PCR. \n\nRelated datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'.\nDataset version 1.0","id":"f3c64a6e-4b9d-45a2-8790-ed6e25a70f88"}

In Central Europe, it can be assumed that continuously forested areas remained for thousands of years only in locations inaccessible to humans (e.g., steep slopes). For most other forested areas, it is obvious that they were completely or partly deforested at least once in the past and used as non-forested land (e.g., arable land or grassland). The wide distribution of historical arable fields (e.g., Celtic fields or ridges-and-furrows) throughout Europe is the best confirmation of this belief. Particularly in the last two decades, the long-lasting effect of previous non-forest uses on patterns and processes of abiotic and biotic parameters of currently forested areas has been studied more intensively. In parallel, the research field of historical ecology, which is not new in itself, has received increased attention and is considered significant to the further study of ecosystems and landscapes. Due to the large number of existing publications, it is possible to summarise the results to date and to identify research gaps that still exist. This information was compiled and is contained in the five sections in this paper. Definitions and procedures are presented in section 2, which is divided into subsections on the definition of landscape legacies, human interventions and time frame establishment (subsection 2.1) and the search and selection of publications (subsection 2.2).

In this paper, the potential for obtaining such high performing nanocrystals from low-cost lignocellulosic by-products or raw materials is proved by a comparison study on CNCs obtained both from cotton linters and kraft pulp, by means of the ammonium persulfate (APS) process. Morphological and chemical characterization of the nanocrystals obtained, as well as the main functional properties of the poly(ethylene terephthalate) coated films, showed quite similar characteristics and performances of CNCs obtained from pure cellulose raw material (cotton linters) and the nanoparticles produced from a potential discard of paper making processes (kraft pulp). In particular, the gas barrier properties of the coating produced with CNCs obtained from kraft pulp were very promising, providing oxygen and carbon dioxide permeability values hundreds of times lower than those of equal thickness in comparison with common barrier synthetic polymers, over a broad range of temperatures. The results obtained are relevant not only for the outstanding performances achieved, but also because they evoke a possible positive example of industrial symbiosis in the packaging field, merging together the requirements and needs of the paper and plastic industries and addressing the way towards a better management of waste and materials.

{"text":"Open AccessSummary Salinity is a devastating abiotic stress accounting for major crop losses yearly. Plant roots can strikingly grow away from high-salt patches. This response is termed halotropism and occurs through auxin redistribution in roots in response to a salt gradient. Here, a natural variation screen for the early and NaCl-specific halotropic response of 333 Arabidopsis accessions revealed quantitative differences in the first 24 h. These data were successfully used to identify genetic components associated with the response through Genome-Wide Association Study (GWAS). Follow-up characterization of knockout mutants in Col-0 background confirmed the role of transcription factor WRKY25, cation-proton exchanger CHX13, and a gene of unknown function DOB1 (Double Bending 1) in halotropism. In chx13 and dob1 mutants, ion accumulation and shoot biomass under salt stress were also affected.

Beneficial root-associated rhizospheric microbes play a key role in maintaining host plant growth and can potentially allow drought-resilient crop production. The complex interaction of root-associated microbes mainly depends on soil type, plant genotype, and soil moisture. However, drought is the most devastating environmental stress that strongly reduces soil biota and can restrict plant growth and yield. In this review, we discussed our mechanistic understanding of drought and microbial response traits. Additionally, we highlighted the role of beneficial microbes and plant-derived metabolites in alleviating drought stress and improving crop growth. We proposed that future research might focus on evaluating the dynamics of root-beneficial microbes under field drought conditions. The integrative use of ecology, microbial, and molecular approaches may serve as a promising strategy to produce more drought-resilient and sustainable crops.

These nanomachines have an important role in inter-bacterial competition and provide advantages to T6SS active strains in polymicrobial environments. Here we analyze the genome of the biocontrol agent Pseudomonas putida KT2440 and identify three T6SS gene clusters (K1-, K2- and K3-T6SS). Besides, 10 T6SS effector\u2013immunity pairs were found, including putative nucleases and pore-forming colicins. We show that the K1-T6SS is a potent antibacterial device, which secretes a toxic Rhs-type effector Tke2. Remarkably, P. putida eradicates a broad range of bacteria in a K1-T6SS-dependent manner, including resilient phytopathogens, which demonstrates that the T6SS is instrumental to empower P. putida to fight against competitors. Furthermore, we observed a drastically reduced necrosis on the leaves of Nicotiana benthamiana during co-infection with P. putida and Xanthomonas campestris. Such protection is dependent on the activity of the P. putida T6SS. Many routes have been explored to develop biocontrol agents capable of manipulating the microbial composition of the rhizosphere and phyllosphere.

{"text":"Climate change can have a plethora of effects on organisms above and below the ground in terrestrial ecosystems. Given the tremendous biodiversity in the soil and the many ecosystem functions governed by soil organisms, the drivers of soil biodiversity have received increasing attention. Various climatic factors like temperature, precipitation, soil moisture, as well as extreme climate events like drought and flood have been shown to alter the composition and functioning of communities in the soil. Earthworms are important ecosystem engineers in the soils of temperate and tropical climates and play crucial roles for many ecosystem services, including decomposition, nutrient cycling, and crop yield. Here, we review the published literature on climate change effects on earthworm communities and activity. In general, we find highly species- and ecological group-specific responses to climate change, which are likely to result in altered earthworm community composition in future ecosystems. Earthworm activity, abundance, and biomass tend to increase with increasing temperature at sufficiently high soil water content, while climate extremes like drought and flooding have deleterious effects. Changing climate conditions may facilitate the invasion of earthworms at higher latitudes and altitudes, while dryer and warmer conditions may limit earthworm performance in other regions of the world. The present summary of available information provides a first baseline for predictions of future earthworm distribution. It also reveals the shortage of studies on interacting effects of multiple global change effects on earthworms, such as potential context-dependent effects of climate change at different soil pollution levels and across ecosystem types.

This study illustrates a comprehensive methodology for phenotyping this crop's water use through the use of the two-source energy balance (TSEB) model employing very high resolution imagery. An unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with multispectral and thermal cameras was used to phenotype 19 durum wheat cultivars grown under three contrasting irrigation treatments matching crop evapotranspiration levels (ETc): 100%ETc treatment meeting all crop water requirements (450 mm), 50%ETc treatment meeting half of them (285 mm), and a rainfed treatment (122 mm). Yield reductions of 18.3 and 48.0% were recorded in the 50%ETc and rainfed treatments, respectively, in comparison with the 100%ETc treatment. UAV flights were carried out during jointing (April 4th), anthesis (April 30th), and grain-filling (May 22nd). Remotely-sensed data were used to estimate: (1) plant height from a digital surface model (H, R2 = 0.95, RMSE = 0.18m), (2) leaf area index from multispectral vegetation indices (LAI, R2 = 0.78, RMSE = 0.63), and (3) actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and transpiration (T) through the TSEB model (R2 = 0.50, RMSE = 0.24 mm/h). Compared with ground measurements, the four traits estimated at grain-filling provided a good prediction of days from sowing to heading (DH, r = 0.58\u20130.86), to anthesis (DA, r = 0.59\u20130.85) and to maturity (r = 0.67\u20130.95), grain-filling duration (GFD, r = 0.54\u20130.74), plant height (r = 0.62\u20130.69), number of grains per spike (NGS, r = 0.41\u20130.64), and thousand kernel weight (TKW, r = 0.37\u20130.42). The best trait to estimate yield, DH, DA, and GFD was ETa at anthesis or during grain filling. Better forecasts for yield-related traits were recorded in the irrigated treatments than in the rainfed one. These results show a promising perspective in the use of energy balance models for the phenotyping of large numbers of durum wheat genotypes under Mediterranean conditions.","id":"10.3389/fpls.2021.658357"}

To highlight the weed management practices used by farmers in conservation agriculture and the changes induced by its adoption, a large sample of 425 French farmers were invited to complete an online survey. Weed management practices used by farmers were requested for three periods: before adoption, during the first years of conservation agriculture (one to two years after adoption), and when the agricultural system is considered &ldquo by the farmer. The use of each farming practice was firstly studied independently for each period. Then, a multiple correspondence analysis followed by a hierarchical ascendant classification resulted in groups of farmers with different combinations of practices for each period. Finally, the groups of farmers were followed through the periods. Results showed that changes in weed management done according to farmers when adopting and mastering conservation agriculture are multiple and vary according to farmers and their previous weed management.

{"text":"<jats:p>Abstract. Citizen science, scientific work and data collection conducted by or with non-experts, is rapidly growing. Although the potential of citizen science activities to generate enormous amounts of data otherwise not feasible is widely recognized, the obtained data are often treated with caution and skepticism. Their quality and reliability is not fully trusted since they are obtained by non-experts using low-cost instruments or scientifically non-verified methods. In this study, we evaluate the performance of Parrot's Flower Power soil moisture sensor used within the European citizen science project, the GROW Observatory (GROW; https://growobservatory.org). The aim of GROW is to enable scientists to validate satellite-based soil moisture products at an unprecedented high spatial resolution through crowdsourced data. To this end, it has mobilized thousands of citizens across Europe in science and climate actions, including hundreds who have been empowered to monitor soil moisture and other environmental variables within twenty four high-density clusters around Europe covering different climate and soil conditions. Clearly, to serve as reference dataset, the quality of ground observations is crucial, especially if obtained from low-cost sensors. To investigate the accuracy of such measurements, the Flower Power sensors were evaluated in the lab and field. For the field trials, they were installed alongside professional soil moisture probes in the Hydrological Open Air Laboratory (HOAL) in Petzenkirchen, Austria. We assessed the skill of the low cost sensors against the professional probes using various methods. Apart from common statistical metrics like correlation, bias and root-mean-square difference, we investigated and compared the temporal stability, soil moisture memory, and the flagging statistics based on the International Soil Moisture Network (ISMN) quality indicators. We found a low inter-sensor variation in the lab and a high temporal agreement with the professional sensors in the field. The results of soil moisture memory and the ISMN quality flags analysis are in a comparable range for the low-cost and professional probes, only the temporal stability analysis shows a contrasting outcome. We demonstrate that low-cost sensors can be used to generate a dataset valuable for environmental monitoring and satellite validation and thus provide the basis for citizen-based soil moisture science.                         </jats:p>","id":"10.5194/gi-2019-38"}

Our results show a relatively large variability of soil management, with fourteen options, as a result of a combination of different alternatives for bare soil and cover crops with the use or not of pruning residues, but with a great similarity between both areas. The results indicate a high adoption of soil conservation measures in the two study areas, with 63% of farmers using cover crops and 80% a mulch of pruning residues, higher than that reported in previous studies in Southern Spain, and a trend of lower use of these techniques by less experienced and younger farmers. This high penetration of soil conservation measures resulted in a significant reduction of soil erosion risk, as indicated by the relatively low values for the cover and management factor (C) of RUSLE, also calculated and presented in this study, but also the possibility of focusing further efforts on farmers with less experience. Our results indicate the persistence of a minor, but relevant, percentage of farmers using bare soil management (37%) and no mulching (20%), with a moderate concern on the impact of soil erosion on soil degradation and provision of ecosystem services. This suggests the need to concentrate efforts also on this cluster of farmers to enhance the success of what seems to be a remarkable expansion of the use of soil conservation measures in recent decades in Southern Spain, but also in similar areas in the Mediterranean basin.

A repacked and saturated sandy soil column experiment was conducted in an environment\u2010controlled laboratory with earthworms (anecic, <jats:italic>Lumbricus terrestris</jats:italic>) inoculated into the soil columns to form networks of macropore. The macropore network parameters (i.e., number, length, volume, diameter, soil saturated conductivity, and tracer breakthrough curves of soil columns) have been determined. The relative arrival times of the tracer mass (i.e. T5%, T25%, and T50%) were determined in order to describe the shapes of the breakthrough curves. The results show that in some breakthrough curves for the treatments with earthworms, there are two peaks. This is an indication that water was flowing faster in the macropores than in the soil matrix. There is a significant correlation between 5% arrival time and the median burrow volume, and the correlation coefficient was .571 (at the level of <jats:italic>p</jats:italic>\u00a0&lt;\u00a0.05). The formation of macropores due to the burrowing activities of earthworms is considered the main cause of nonequilibrium water flow in the present study.

{"text":"Open AccessPeer reviewed Plant root systems are exposed to spatial and temporal heterogeneity regarding water availability. In the long-term, compensation, increased uptake by roots in areas with favorable conditions in response to decreased uptake in areas under stress, is driven by root growth and distribution. In the short-term (hours\u2013days), compensative processes are less understood. We hypothesized hydraulic compensation where local lowered water availability is accompanied by increased uptake from areas where water remains available. Our objective was to quantify instantaneous hydraulic root uptake under conditions of differential water availability. Tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) plants were grown in split-root weighing-drainage lysimeters in which each half of the roots could alternatively be exposed to short-term conditions of salinity. Uptake was quantified from each of the two root zone compartments. One-sided exposure to salinity immediately led to less uptake from the salt-affected compartment and increased uptake from the nontreated compartment. Compensation occurred at salinity, caused by NaCl solution of 4 dS m\u22121, that did not decrease uptake in plants with entire root systems exposed. At higher salinity, 6.44 dS m\u22121, transpiration decreased by \u223c50% when the total root system was exposed. When only half of the roots were exposed, total uptake was maintained at levels of nonstressed plants with as much as 85% occurring from the nontreated compartment. The extent of compensation was not absolute and apparently a function of salinity, atmospheric demand, and duration of exposure. As long as there is no hydraulic restriction in other areas, temporary reduction in water availability in some parts of a tomato's root zone will not affect plant-scale transpiration.

The crop-water production function (CWPF) is widely used to quantitatively describe relationships between crop water deficit and yield, and evaluate the effects of different irrigation strategies in agro-hydrological models. In order to reasonably and reliably estimate crop yield and optimize irrigation scheduling, a novel CWPF was proposed by combining the plant water deficit index (PWDI), estimated based on root-weighted soil water availability, with a daily water sensitivity index derived from a sigmoidal cumulative function. Parameterized using data from a two-year winter wheat field lysimetric experiment conducted in the North China Plain and from a previously published two-year spring maize field drip irrigation experiment in Inner Mongolia, China, the CWPFs provided reasonable estimation of different crop yields with different water stress response characteristics under different field environments. Through coupling the genetic algorithm with the integrated simulations of soil water dynamics, PWDI and CWPF in the soil-wheat system, an optimization procedure was developed to determine PWDI threshold combinations to timely trigger irrigation according to pre-designed crop water deficit status. Crop yield and water use efficiency (WUE) of winter wheat were estimated and compared under different optimized constant and variable PWDI threshold combinations. In addition, the effects of climate change on the optimized variable PWDI threshold combinations were investigated using 38 years of historic meteorological data. The results showed that regulated deficit irrigation (RDI) with a variable threshold combination, in which the sensitivity characteristics to water deficit were considered for the crop at different growth stages, was superior to a constant threshold in enhancing crop yield and WUE. Irrespective of the number of irrigation events (1, 2, 3 or 4) during the growing season, the coefficients of variation (CV) of optimized PWDI thresholds for different combinations of irrigation sequence and events were not very large under the same kind of hydrological year (wet, normal or dry), with CV < 0.39 and a median of 0.21. When the mean (MN) of the optimized PWDI threshold combinations for different irrigation sequence and events was used to schedule RDI of winter wheat in terms of various hydrological years, up to 91% of the estimated relative yield was found to be higher than 90% of the corresponding maximum values. Therefore, the MN can be valuable in formulating rational irrigation management strategies of winter wheat to achieve relatively high yields with limited water under changing climatic conditions.","id":"10.1016/j.fcr.2022.108579"}
{"text":"Microbial growth is a clear example of organization and structure arising in nonequilibrium conditions. Due to the complexity of the microbial metabolic network, elucidating the fundamental principles governing microbial growth remains a challenge. Here, we present a systematic analysis of microbial growth thermodynamics, leveraging an extensive dataset on energy-limited monoculture growth. A consistent thermodynamic framework based on reaction stoichiometry allows us to quantify how much of the available energy microbes can efficiently convert into new biomass while dissipating the remaining energy into the environment and producing entropy. We show that dissipation mechanisms can be linked to the electron donor uptake rate, a fact leading to the central result that the thermodynamic efficiency is related to the electron donor uptake rate by the scaling law eta proportional to M-1/2 ED and to the growth yield by eta proportional to Y4/5. These findings allow us to rederive the Pirt equation from a thermodynamic perspective, providing a means to compute its coefficients, as well as a deeper understanding of the relationship between growth rate and yield. Our results provide rather general insights into the relation between mass and energy conversion in microbial growth with potentially wide application, especially in ecology and biotechnology.","id":"10.1073/pnas.2107668118"}
{"text":"Open AccessPeer reviewed The developed method was evaluated for the determination of 10 antibiotics belonging to four chemical classes (fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, lincosamides, and metoxybenzylpyrimidines) and six of their metabolites in four vegetable matrices (lettuce, tomato, cauliflower, and broad beans). The reported method detection limits were sufficiently low (0.1\u20135.8 ng/g dry weight) to detect target compounds in vegetables under real agricultural practices. Absolute and relative recovery values ranged from 40 to 118% and from 70 to 118%, respectively, for all targeted compounds at the spike level of 100 ng/g dry weight. Regarding method precision, the highest relative standard deviation (RSD) was obtained for enrofloxacin in lettuce (20%), while for the rest of the compounds in all matrices, the RSD values were below 20% for the same spike level. Matrix effects, due to electrospray ionization, ranged from \u2212 26 to 29% for 85% of all estimated values. In a field study, four of the 10 targeted antibiotics were detected in tested vegetables. For the first time, antibiotic metabolites were quantified in vegetables grown under real field conditions. More specifically, decarboxyl ofloxacin and TMP304 were detected in tomato fruits (1.5 ng/g dry weight) and lettuce leaves (21.0\u201323.1 ng/g dry weight), respectively. It is important to remark that the concentration of TMP304 was five times higher than that from the parental compound, emphasizing the importance of metabolite analysis in monitoring studies. Therefore, the method provided a robust, reliable, and simple-to-use tool that could prove useful for routine multiclass analysis of antibiotics and their metabolites in vegetable samples.

{"text":"Open AccessMinisterio de Econom\u00eda y Competitividad | Ref. RYC-2015\u201318758 Microorganisms play a key role in nutrient cycling in agriculture and can contribute to improve soil quality and enhance crop production. Thus, there is a need to identify the most suitable management practices which foster increases in soil microbial biomass and diversity. A meta-analysis was performed to assess changes in microbial abundance in agricultural soils affected by: (i) management practices (tillage, fertilization and crop diversification); and (ii) environmental factors, including climate characteristics and soil properties. The scope of the meta-analysis was to evaluate whether microbial abundances are affected or not by organic fertilization or no fertilization, crop diversification (intercropping and crop rotations) and conservation tillage (reduced tillage/no-tillage) as an alternative to intensive conventional monocultures in agriculture. Only papers showing data on phospholipid fatty acids (PLFAs), providing indicators about soil microbial (total PLFA), fungal and bacterial biomass reached a critical mass to perform the meta-analysis. Therefore, soil microbial diversity could not be analyzed considering different management practices. Results showed that intercropping and crop rotations only significantly increased the abundance of fungi, with the corresponding increase in the fungal-to-bacterial ratio. Organic fertilization contributed to significant increases in bacterial and fungal abundance and total PLFA compared to mineral fertilization. Contrarily, the lack of fertilization negatively affected total PLFA, with no significant effect on bacterial and fungal abundances. Reduced tillage significantly increased total PLFA, fungal and bacterial abundances compared to conventional tillage, while no tillage had only a positive effect on fungi. Thus, as a general pattern, the adoption of sustainable management practices, mostly organic fertilization and reduced tillage, has overall positive effects on soil total microbial, fungal and bacterial abundance. These variables were not related to soil physicochemical properties and climatic factors, suggesting a positive global effect of sustainable management practices on soil microbial abundances. Thus, this study shows new insights by a meta-analysis of global studies about the effect of sustainable management practices on soil microbial abundances, needed for land-managers, policy-makers and farmers to select sustainable cropping systems that enhance microbial abundance.

{"text":"Abstract   Carbon-rich soils, like histosols or gelisols, cover more than 3% of the Earth's land surface, and store roughly three times more carbon than the Earth's forests. Carbon-rich soils are reactive porous materials, prone to smouldering combustion if the inert and moisture contents are low enough. An example of soil combustion happens in peatlands, where smouldering wildfires are common in both boreal and tropical regions. This work focuses on understanding soil ignition by self-heating, which is due to spontaneous exothermic reactions in the presence of oxygen under certain thermal conditions. We investigate the effect of soil inorganic content by creating under controlled conditions soil samples with inorganic content (IC) ranging from 3% to 86% of dry weight: we use sand as a surrogate of inorganic matter and peat as a surrogate of organic matter. This range is very wide and covers all IC values of known carbon-rich soils on Earth. The experimental results show that self-heating ignition in different soil types is possible, even with the 86% inorganic content, but the tendency to ignite decreases quickly with increasing IC. We report a clear increase in ambient temperature required for ignition as the IC increases. Combining results from 39 thermostatically-controlled oven experiments, totalling 401\u00a0h of heating time, with the Frank-Kamenetskii theory of ignition, the lumped chemical kinetic and thermal parameters are determined. We then use these parameters to upscale the laboratory experiments to soil layers of different thicknesses for a range of ambient temperatures ranging from 0\u00a0\u00b0C to 40\u00a0\u00b0C. The analysis predicts the critical soil layer thicknesses in nature for self-ignition at various possible environmental temperatures. For example, at 40\u00a0\u00b0C a soil layer of 3% inorganic content can be ignited through self-heating if it is thicker than 8.8\u00a0m, but at 86% IC the layer has to be 1.8\u00a0km thick, which is impossible to find in nature. We estimate that the critical IC for a ambient temperature of 40\u00a0\u00b0C and soil thickness of 50\u00a0m is 68%. Because those are extreme values of temperature and thickness, no self-heating ignition of soil can be expected above the 68% threshold of inorganic content. This is the first in-depth experimental quantification of soil self-heating and shows that indeed it is possible that wildfires are initiated by self-heating in some soil types and conditions.","id":"10.1016/j.firesaf.2017.03.052"}

{"text":"Abstract   In order to understand the coupling of carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycles, it is necessary to understand C and N-use efficiencies of microbial soil organic matter (SOM) decomposition. While important controls of those efficiencies by microbial community adaptations have been shown at the scale of a soil pore, an abstract simplified representation of community adaptations is needed at ecosystem scale.  Therefore we developed the soil enzyme allocation model (SEAM), which takes a holistic, partly optimality based approach to describe C and N dynamics at the spatial scale of an ecosystem and time-scales of years and longer. We explicitly modelled community adaptation strategies of resource allocation to extracellular enzymes and enzyme limitations on SOM decomposition. Using SEAM, we explored whether alternative strategy-hypotheses can have strong effects on SOM and inorganic N cycling.  Results from prototypical simulations and a calibration to observations of an intensive pasture site showed that the so-called revenue enzyme allocation strategy was most viable. This strategy accounts for microbial adaptations to both, stoichiometry and amount of different SOM resources, and supported the largest microbial biomass under a wide range of conditions. Predictions of the holistic SEAM model were qualitatively similar to precitions of the SYMPHONY model, which explicitly represents competing microbial guilds. With adaptive enzyme allocation under conditions of high C/N ratio of litter inputs, N that was formerly locked in slowly degrading SOM pools was made accessible, whereas with high N inputs, N was sequestered in SOM and protected from leaching.  The findings imply that it is important for ecosystem scale models to account for adaptation of C and N use efficiencies in order to represent C-N couplings. The combination of stoichiometry and optimality principles is a promising route to yield simple formulations of such adaptations at community level suitable for incorporation into land surface models.","id":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2017.08.031"}
{"text":"Open AccessNetwork analysis has been used for many years in ecological research to analyze organismal associations, for example in food webs, plant-plant or plant-animal interactions. Although network analysis is widely applied in microbial ecology, only recently has it entered the realms of soil microbial ecology, shown by a rapid rise in studies applying co-occurrence analysis to soil microbial communities. While this application offers great potential for deeper insights into the ecological structure of soil microbial ecosystems, it also brings new challenges related to the specific characteristics of soil datasets and the type of ecological questions that can be addressed. In this Perspectives Paper we assess the challenges of applying network analysis to soil microbial ecology due to the small-scale heterogeneity of the soil environment and the nature of soil microbial datasets. We review the different approaches of network construction that are commonly applied to soil microbial datasets and discuss their features and limitations. Using a test dataset of microbial communities from two depths of a forest soil, we demonstrate how different experimental designs and network constructing algorithms affect the structure of the resulting networks, and how this in turn may influence ecological conclusions. We will also reveal how assumptions of the construction method, methods of preparing the dataset, and definitions of thresholds affect the network structure. Finally, we discuss the particular questions in soil microbial ecology that can be approached by analyzing and interpreting specific network properties. Targeting these network properties in a meaningful way will allow applying this technique not in merely descriptive, but in hypothesis-driven research. Analysing microbial networks in soils opens a window to a better understanding of the complexity of microbial communities.

{"text":"Open AccessMicroorganisms commonly inhabit energy-limited ecosystems where cellular maintenance and reproduction is highly constrained. To gain insight into how individuals persist under such conditions, we derived demographic parameters from a collection of 21 heterotrophic bacterial taxa by censusing 100 populations in an effectively closed system for 1,000 d. All but one taxon survived prolonged resource scarcity, yielding estimated times to extinction ranging over four orders of magnitude from 100 to 105 y. Our findings corroborate reports of long-lived bacteria recovered from ancient environmental samples, while providing insight into mechanisms of persistence. As death rates declined over time, lifespan was extended through the scavenging of dead cells. Although reproduction was suppressed in the absence of exogenous resources, populations continued to evolve. Hundreds of mutations were acquired, contributing to genome-wide signatures of purifying selection as well as molecular signals of adaptation. Consistent ecological and evolutionary dynamics indicate that distantly related bacteria respond to energy limitation in a similar and predictable manner, which likely contributes to the stability and robustness of microbial life. Significance Energy limitation is a widespread phenomenon that governs microbial processes ranging from the metabolism of individual cells to the functioning of the biosphere. By tracking the population dynamics of diverse bacterial taxa under prolonged starvation, we identified common strategies that sustain life. Although bacteria have the capacity to reproduce on timescales of minutes to hours, we predict that populations can persist for hundreds to thousands of years, placing upper bounds on microbial lifespans. While the dynamics observed in our long-term experiment were driven by a reduction in death rates, cryptic birth events generated mutations that fueled evolution. Our findings shed light on cellular longevity with implications for biodiversity in extreme environments that dominate vast expanses of Earth.","id":"10.1073/pnas.2113148118"}
{"text":"Abstract   Constructed wetlands are an effective biofilter-based technology for treating wastewater in a sustainable way; however, their main disadvantage is a large area footprint. To cope with this limitation a new generation of constructed wetlands, the METlands\u00ae, have been recently reported. METlands\u00ae replace gravel with a granular electrically conductive material to enhance the oxidative metabolisms of electroactive bacteria by facilitating the flux of electron through the material and, consequently, increase bioremediation rates. In this work we evaluated the performance of a new electron sink (e-sink) device with the purpose of controlling and enhancing the electrochemical consumption of electrons from microbial metabolism without energy consumption. The e-sink device was integrated inside the biofilter bed and was tested using different electron acceptors with high redox potentials, like oxygen and hypochlorite. Interestingly, the presence of the e-sink allowed novel redox gradients to form inside the METland\u00ae and, consequently, a new electron flow was demonstrated by measuring both the electric potential and current density profiles of the bed. Three independent biofilters were constructed and operated under flooded conditions. Ec-coke and electroconductive biochar (ec-biochar) were used as electrically conductive bed materials, while gravel was used as an inert control. Furthermore, e-sink integration inside the electrically conductive bed outperformed METlands\u00ae for removing pollutants, already much more efficient than standard gravel biofilters. COD removal was increased from 90% in METland\u00ae to 95% in the e-sink METland\u00ae as compared to 75% for the control, while total nitrogen removal was enhanced from 64% in METland\u00ae to 71% in e-sink METland\u00ae as compared to 55% for the control. Our results indicate that increasing the electrochemical availability of electron acceptors by using the e-sink will be a suitable method for controlling the electron flow inside the filter bed and can be integrated in full scale METlands\u00ae for achieving high removal rates.","id":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.139522"}
{"text":"Open AccessComment: 13 pages, 10 figures, accepted for publication in MNRAS Gravitational lensing is a powerful tool for constraining substructure in the mass distribution of galaxies, be it from the presence of dark matter sub-halos or due to physical mechanisms affecting the baryons throughout galaxy evolution. Such substructure is hard to model and is either ignored by traditional, smooth modelling, approaches, or treated as well-localized massive perturbers. In this work, we propose a deep learning approach to quantify the statistical properties of such perturbations directly from images, where only the extended lensed source features within a mask are considered, without the need of any lens modelling. Our training data consist of mock lensed images assuming perturbing Gaussian Random Fields permeating the smooth overall lens potential, and, for the first time, using images of real galaxies as the lensed source. We employ a novel deep neural network that can handle arbitrary uncertainty intervals associated with the training dataset labels as input, provides probability distributions as output, and adopts a composite loss function. The method succeeds not only in accurately estimating the actual parameter values, but also reduces the predicted confidence intervals by 10 per cent in an unsupervised manner, i.e., without having access to the actual ground truth values. Our results are invariant to the inherent degeneracy between mass perturbations in the lens and complex brightness profiles for the source. Hence, we can quantitatively and robustly quantify the smoothness of the mass density of thousands of lenses, including confidence intervals, and provide a consistent ranking for follow-up science.","id":"10.1093/mnras/staa3201"}

A thorough understanding of the implications of this for litter decomposition is essential to make predictions of soil-atmosphere carbon (C) feedbacks. Soil nitrogen (N) and C cycles naturally are interlinked, but we lack a detailed understanding of how insect herbivores impact these cycles. In a laboratory microcosm study, we investigated the growth responses of heterotrophic soil fungi and bacteria as well as C and N mineralisation to simulated defoliator outbreaks (frass addition), long-term increased insect herbivory (litter addition at higher background N-level) and non-outbreak conditions (litter addition only) in soils from a Subarctic birch forest. Larger amounts of the added organic matter were mineralised in the outbreak simulations compared to a normal year; yet, the fungal and bacterial growth rates and biomass were not significantly different. In the simulation of long-term increased herbivory, less litter C was respired per unit mineralised N (C:N of mineralisation decreased to 20 +/- 1 from 38 +/- 3 for pure litter), which suggests a directed microbial mining for N-rich substrates. This was accompanied by higher fungal dominance relative to bacteria and lower total microbial biomass. In conclusion, while a higher fraction of foliar C will be respired by insects and microbes during outbreak years, predicted long-term increases in herbivory linked to climate change may facilitate soil C-accumulation, as less foliar C is respired per unit mineralised N. Further work elucidating animal-plant-soil interactions is needed to improve model predictions of C-sink capacity in high latitude forest ecosystems.","id":"10.1007/s10533-018-0448-8"}
{"text":"Abstract   Moderately volatile elements (MVEs) are sensitive tracers of vaporisation in geological and cosmochemical processes owing to their balanced partitioning between vapour and condensed phases. Differences in their volatilities allows the thermodynamic conditions, particularly temperature and oxygen fugacity ( f O 2 ), at which vaporisation occurred to be quantified. However, this exercise is hindered by a lack of experimental data relevant to the evaporation of MVEs from silicate melts. We report a series of experiments in which silicate liquids are evaporated in one-atmosphere (1-atm) gas-mixing furnaces under controlled  f O 2 s, from the Fe-\u201cFeO\u201d buffer (iron-wustite, IW) to air (10 -0.68  bars), bracketing the range of most magmatic rocks. Time- ( t ) and temperature ( T)  series were conducted from 15 to 930 minutes and 1300-1550\u00b0C, at or above the liquidus for a synthetic ferrobasalt, to which 20 elements, each at 1000 ppm, were added. Refractory elements ( e.g. , Ca, Sc, V, Zr, REE) are quantitatively retained in the melt under all conditions. The MVEs show highly redox-dependent volatilities, where the extent of element loss as a function of  f O 2  depends on the stoichiometry of the evaporation reaction(s), each of which has the general form M x+   n  O (x+   n   )/2  = M x O x/2  +  n /4O 2 . Where  n  is positive (as in most cases), the oxidation state of the element in the gas is more reduced than in the liquid, meaning lower oxygen fugacity promotes evaporation. We develop a general framework, by integrating element vaporisation stoichiometries with Hertz-Knudsen-Langmuir (HKL) theory, to quantify evaporative loss as a function of  t ,  T  and  f O 2 . Element volatilities from silicate melts differ from those during solar nebular condensation, and can thus constrain the conditions of volatile loss in post-nebular processes. Evaporation in a single event strongly discriminates between MVEs, producing a step-like abundance pattern in the residuum, similar to that observed in the Moon or Vesta. Contrastingly, the gradual depletion of MVEs according to their volatility in the Earth is inconsistent with their loss in a single evaporation event, and instead likely reflects accretion from many smaller bodies that had each experienced different degrees of volatilisation.","id":"10.1016/j.gca.2019.06.021"}

The Ca isotopic composition of all spinifex textured komatiites analyzed is similar, with an average \u03b444/40Ca\u202f=\u202f0.92\u202f\u00b1\u202f0.16\u2030 (n\u202f=\u202f7; 2SD) (permil deviation of the 44Ca/40Ca ratio from SRM915a).

In contrast, olivine cumulates from the Weltevreden Formation in the Barberton Greenstone Belt are isotopically heavier compared to the rest of the komatiites studied.

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience The silicon isotope composition of detrital quartz and zircon have the potential to inform us about secular changes to the silica cycle and weathering reactions on Earth. However, inferring source melt Si isotope composition from out-of-context minerals is hampered by the fact that, to-date, there is limited Si isotope equilibrium fractionation data for minerals. Here, we report experimental data to constrain Si isotope equilibrium fractionation between zircon and quartz, using two fundamentally different strategies, but with the same experimental design. First, zircon and quartz were hydrothermally synthesized from Zr(OH)4 and SiO2 at 1.5\u202fGPa and temperatures of 725, 800, and 900\u202f\u00b0C. The second experimental strategy utilized the three-isotope method; the starting materials consisted of natural zircon and isotopically-labelled SiO2. Three sets of hydrothermal time-series experiments were conducted at the same pressure and temperatures as the direct synthesis experiments. For all experiments, quartz and zircon were separated and 30Si/28Si and 29Si/28Si ratios were measured by solution multi-collector inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry. The three-isotope method, which provides the best indicator of equilibrium fractionations, yields the following relationship:\u0394^30 Si(qtz-zrc) = (0.53\u00b10.14)\u00d710^6/T^2.where \u0394^30 Si(qtz-zrc) is the relative difference in 30Si/28Si between quartz and zircon in permil, T is temperature in K, and the error is 2\u202fs.e. This relationship can be used to calculate the fractionation between zircon and other phases, and to estimate the Si isotope composition of the melt from which a zircon crystallized. The results may be used to assess equilibrium-disequilibrium isotope fractionations between quartz and zircon and co-existing phases in igneous rocks. These data can also be applied to out-of-context zircon (and quartz) to estimate the isotope composition of the host rock.

The fractionation factor of isotopes i and j of element E between gas and liquid, i/jE(\u03b1vap-liq), in the former case depends only on the molar masses of the evaporating species, (Mj/Mi)0.5, whereas, at equilibrium, the fractionation factor is \u223c1 at high temperatures. The prevailing regime depends on the production rate of vapour species relative to their rate of transport away from the evaporating surface, for which an accurate theory is lacking. Here, we present results of Cu and Zn isotope fractionation during evaporation of ferrobasaltic melts in the FeO(T)-CaO-MgO-Al2O3-SiO2 (FCMAS) system in a 1\u202fatm gas-mixing furnace at oxygen fugacities (fO2) from 10\u22128 bar to 10\u22120.68 bar (air) at temperatures between 1300 and 1500\u202f\u00b0C.

This behaviour is caused by slow elemental diffusion through the silicate melt relative to the rate of evaporative loss, thereby depressing i/jE(\u03b1vap-liq). When evaporation rates far exceed those for diffusion in the melt, no isotopic fractionation develops in the condensed phase. To account for the 65/63Cu(\u03b1vap-liq) and 66/64Zn(\u03b1vap-liq) values observed in air, we develop a formalism for mass transfer applicable to any evaporating species over a range of pressures, gas compositions and flow regimes. For natural convection at 1\u202fbar, diffusive transport through the gas is the rate-limiting step, where D(i,j)k is the diffusion rate of isotope i or j through a gas with mean molar mass Mk. Under these conditions i/jE(\u03b1vap-liq) is proportional to (Dik/Djk)2/3, and not (Dik/Djk) as previously proposed. Our model predicts i/jE(\u03b1vap-liq) in other experiments, and in nature, to a precision of \u00b10.0005 assuming ideality. The fractionation factors inferred for moderately volatile elements in lunar mare basalts (>0.9994) are inconsistent with a mass transport process, and instead reflect near-equilibrium conditions of vapour loss from the Moon.","id":"10.1016/j.gca.2020.08.011"}

{"text":"Abstract   A precise estimate of the evapotranspiration (ET) partitioning is fundamental for determining the crop water needs and optimizing irrigation management. The plant transpiration (T) is generally considered to be the most desirable component, while reducing the soil evaporation (E) could be one of the most important water-saving actions in semi-arid agricultural regions. Given the lack of reference method to estimate the E/T partitioning of wheat crop, this study inter-compares four different methods based on eddy covariance, sap flow and lysimetry measurements and FAO modeling. The objectives are: i) to quantify the systematic and random uncertainty in E and T observations, ii) to evaluate the partitioning ratio (T/ET) at the daily/field scale and iii) to assess the performance of the FAO model over two drip irrigated wheat fields. Results indicate that despite the small surface sensed by mini-lysimeters, the partitioning ratio is evaluated more precisely (19% relative error) with lysimetry than with the other systems (any combination of eddy covariance, lysimetry and sap flow measurements). Moreover, stem-scale T measurements from sap flow sensors are subject to representativeness issues at the field scale, and to systematic errors during water-stress and senescence periods. The lysimeter-derived partitioning ratio increases from about 0.50 to 0.85 during the growth stage and rapidly drops towards 0 during senescence. Its dynamics is found to be significantly correlated (R>0.7) with the 5-cm soil moisture. By comparing FAO simulations with observations, it is found that the FAO method overestimates T and underestimates E, while keeping satisfying ET estimates for drip irrigated wheat. This study suggests that different independent measurement techniques should be implemented to both quantify and reduce uncertainties in the T/ET ratio, and that accurate observations are still needed to improve the modeling of E/T components.","id":"10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.11.031"}

In a drip-irrigated vineyard soil evaporation (E) can reach up to 30-40% of the seasonal grapevine crop evapotranspiration (ETc). Vineyard soil management can be used as a technique to reduce soil E for improving crop water use efficiency. The aim of this experiment was to analyze the effect of using pruning waste as an organic mulching on vineyard ETc. During three experimental seasons, several cycles of grapevines water use determinations were conducted using a large weighing lysimeter located in Albacete (southeast Spain) under drip irrigation. Measurements were carried out under different soil management practices: i) keeping the bare soil within the lysimeter during the first 2-3 days (bare soil), ii) covering the lysimeter soil surface with pruning waste as an organic mulching (about 5 cm thick) for the next 2-3 days (organic mulch), and iii) covering the lysimeter with a waterproof canvas (plastic mulch), similar in colour to the soil, for the last 2-3 days of each measurement cycle. In 2017, the measurements period was initiated when midday stem water potential (\u03a8stem) values reached -1.3 MPa, in order to study the effect of the different soil management on grapevine ETc when vines in the lysimeter were suffering from severe water stress. During the 3-year study, plant determinations (i.e., canopy cover and the phenological stage) showed that vines were at the same stage of development during each period of measurements. Under equal evaporative demand and fractional canopy cover, results showed a reduction in the vineyard ETc between 16-18% with the organic mulching, and up to 24-30% with the plastic mulching. Even though plastic mulches significantly reduced water evaporation from soil surface, this reduction could have resulted in an increase in crop transpiration (T). However, results in this experiment show that both organic and inorganic mulching did not increase vine T compared to no mulching conditions, based on vine T values estimated during the three experimental periods of 2015. Therefore, using pruning waste as an organic mulch could be an environmental friendly alternative to reduce soil evaporation and increase crop water productivity in large areas where vineyards are drip-irrigated.

The spatial kriging-interpolated maps allowed separating zones of lower and higher yields with EOMs compared to the control.

{"text":"<jats:p>Abstract. Including a terrestrial nitrogen (N) cycle in Earth system models has led to substantial attenuation of predicted biosphere\u2013climate feedbacks. However, the magnitude of this attenuation remains uncertain. A particularly important but highly uncertain process is biological nitrogen fixation (BNF), which is the largest natural input of N to land ecosystems globally. In order to quantify this uncertainty and estimate likely effects on terrestrial biosphere dynamics, we applied six alternative formulations of BNF spanning the range of process formulations in current state-of-the-art biosphere models within a common framework, the O-CN model: a global map of static BNF rates, two empirical relationships between BNF and other ecosystem variables (net primary productivity and evapotranspiration), two process-oriented formulations based on plant N status, and an optimality-based approach. We examined the resulting differences in model predictions under ambient and elevated atmospheric [CO2] and found that the predicted global BNF rates and their spatial distribution for contemporary conditions were broadly comparable, ranging from 108 to 148 Tg N yr\u22121 (median: 128 Tg N yr\u22121), despite distinct regional patterns associated with the assumptions of each approach. Notwithstanding, model responses in BNF rates to elevated levels of atmospheric [CO2] (+200 ppm) ranged between \u22124 Tg N yr\u22121 (\u22123 %) and 56 Tg N yr\u22121 (+42 %) (median: 7 Tg N yr\u22121 (+8 %)).

Stomatal conductance, closely related to water flow in the soil-plant-atmosphere continuum, is an important parameter in the Penman-Monteith (P-M) model for estimating evapotranspiration (ET). In this study, a novel soil water stress index \u03c9, considering intrinsic soil-plant water relations, was introduced into the Jarvis empirical estimation model of stomatal conductance to improve the representation of the effect of soil water stress on stomatal conductance. The index \u03c9 accounted not only for current water availability by combing the effects of relative distribution of soil water to roots and nonlinear stomatal response, but also for the hysteresis effect of water stress by means of the inclusion of a recovery coefficient. Combined plant and soil-based measurements from a greenhouse experiment provided the basis for investigating the relationship between leaf stomatal conductance gs and root zone soil water stress represented by \u03c9. The response of gs to root-weighted soil matric potential was found to be nonlinear. The relationship between gs and the extent of previous water stress (i.e. the water stress recovery coefficient curve) was generalized by a power function and was verified and confirmed using results obtained from the literature. The reliability of \u03c9 was tested by coupling it into the Jarvis model to estimate leaf (gs) and canopy (gc) stomatal conductance, and thereupon into the P-M model to estimate cumulative ET (CET) in the greenhouse experiment and two field experiments. The estimated gs, gc and CET agreed well with the measurements, with root mean squared error not more than 0.0006 m s\u22121, 0.0020 m s\u22121 and 8.2 mm, respectively, and determination coefficient (Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient) consistently greater than 65% (0.14). Therefore, \u03c9 should be feasible and reliable to delineate the response of stomatal physiological reaction to water stress, and hence helpful for accurate estimation of ET using Jarvis-based P-M models.","id":"10.1016/j.agrformet.2021.108393"}
{"text":"Abstract: Historically, the autumn dynamics of deciduous forest trees have not been investigated in detail. However, autumn phenological events, like onset of loss of canopy greenness (OLCG), onset of foliar senescence (OFS) and cessation of wood growth (CWG), have an important impact on tree radial growth and the entire ecosystem's seasonal dynamics. Here, we monitored the leaf and wood phenological events of silver birch (Betula pendula) at four different sites in angstrom s, southeastern Norway: (a) a natural mature stand, (b) a plantation on former agricultural ground, (c) young natural trees, and (d) young trees in pots under different fertilization levels. The study took place over four consecutive years (from 2017 to 2020), with a particular focus on 2018, a year in which there was a severe summer drought, and the next year, 2019, which featured more normal conditions. First, we provided a description of birch phenology within its mid-north distributional. Second, we showed that drought advanced CWG by about 5 to 6 weeks and it delayed OLCG and OFS up to 30 days. Third, we observed an unexpected advance in OLCG in 2019 compared to 2018 (30 days) and 2020 (14 days). OFS presented similar dynamics as OLCG, whereas CWG was advanced only in 2018. These findings might indicate lag-effects of severe drought on the next year autumn leaf phenology but not on wood growth. On the other hand, the comparison between the natural stand and the plantation showed that, under drought conditions, wood growth is more sensitive to site fertility than autumn leaf phenology. In summary, our study elucidated the autumn dynamics of an important deciduous forest species in the northern temperate zone and showed unexpected impacts of a severely dry and warm summer on the current and next year leaf phenology.","id":"10.1016/j.agrformet.2022.108879"}
{"text":"Abstract   A meta-analysis specially based on tree crops was conducted to evaluate the changes in soil organic carbon (SOC), soil N and P, and crop yield in a Mediterranean climate, which are affected by: (i) management practices (crop diversification, tillage, fertilization); (ii) environmental characteristics, such as soil clay and climatic variables; and (iii) study length. The aim of this study was to assess the benefits of crop diversification, conservation tillage (minimum tillage/no-tillage) and organic fertilization as alternatives to intensive conventional mono-cropping in field studies. All the diversified systems and conservation tillage systems and the use of organic fertilizers induced positive effects on SOC. The highest response in SOC was achieved by the growth of permanent crops in the alleys. Soil N showed a similar trend to that of SOC, but the effect of no-tillage was not significant compared to conventional tillage. No significant effect was observed in soil P except for the cultivation of permanent crops in the alleys, which had a negative effect. No effect was observed in tree crop yield due to the growth of alley crops, conservation tillage or organic fertilization. However, the response of crop yield was related to the specific climatic conditions of each region, with possible negative effects in warm and dry areas. Overall, the use of intercropping, conservation tillage and organic fertilization led to improvements in soil quality and fertility and maintenance of a ground cover that can protect soil. However, to avoid possible negative effects on soil P and N availability, the growth of annual alley crops with minimum tillage is suggested instead of permanent crops with no-tillage, especially in dry and warm areas. Our results also suggested that the soil properties evaluated were not the main drivers of long-term yield variability.","id":"10.1016/j.agsy.2019.102736"}
{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience Root surfaces are major sites of interactions between plants and associated microorganisms. Here, plants and microbes communicate via signaling molecules, compete for nutrients, and release substrates that may have beneficial or harmful effects on each other. Whilst the body of knowledge on the abundance and diversity of microbial communities at root-soil interfaces is now substantial, information on their spatial distribution at the microscale is still scarce. In this study, a standardized method for recognizing and analyzing microbial cell distributions on root surfaces is presented. Fluorescence microscopy was combined with automated image analysis and spatial statistics to explore the distribution of bacterial colonization patterns on rhizoplanes of rice roots. To test and evaluate the presented approach, a gnotobiotic experiment was performed using a potential nitrogen-fixing bacterial strain in combination with roots of wetland rice. The automated analysis procedure resulted in reliable spatial data of bacterial cells colonizing the rhizoplane. Among all replicate roots, the analysis revealed an increasing density of bacterial cells from the root tip to the region of root cell maturation. Moreover, bacterial cells showed significant spatial clustering and tended to be located around plant root cell borders. The quantitative data suggest that the structure of the root surface plays a major role in bacterial colonization patterns. Possible adaptations of the presented approach for future studies are discussed along with potential pitfalls such as inaccurate imaging. Our results demonstrate that standardized recognition and statistical evaluation of microbial colonization on root surfaces holds the potential to increase our understanding of microbial associations with roots and of the underlying ecological interactions.","id":"10.3389/fenvs.2018.00061"}
{"text":"Open AccessSIGNIFICANCE: Manure quality in the EU requires greater attention, calling for more targeted policies. Our proposed approach could be applied by European Union Member States to include soil protection measures in national legislation, and at the EU level, can enable the implementation of strategic goals. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: This review found that coupling manure management with soil biodiversity can mitigate present and future environmental risks. Our analyses showed that manure quality is more important to soil biodiversity than manure quantity and therefore, agricultural practices that protect and promote soil biodiversity with the application of appropriate, high-quality manure or biostimulant preparations based on manure, could accelerate the move towards more sustainable food production systems. Soil biodiversity needs to be appropriately factored in when assessing manure amendments to provide better guidelines on the use of manure and to reduce costs and environmental risks. However, radical changes in current philosophies and practices are needed so that soil biodiversity can be enhanced by manure management. METHODS: This review explored the relationship between manure and soil biodiversity by considering 407 published papers and relevant legislative provisions. In addition, we evaluated whether benefits and risks on soil biodiversity are considered in manure management. Thereafter, we analysed the current legislation in the European Union relevant to manure, an important driver for its treatment, application and storage. CONTEXT: In the European Union (EU-27) and UK, animal farming generated annually more than 1.4 billion tonnes of manure during the period 2016\u20132019. Of this, more than 90% is directly re-applied to soils as organic fertiliser. Manure promotes plant growth, provides nutritious food to soil organisms, adds genetic and functional diversity to soils and improves the chemical and physical soil properties. However, it can also cause pollution by introducing toxic elements (i.e., heavy metals, antibiotics, pathogens) and contribute to nutrient losses. Soil organisms play an essential role in manure transformation into the soil and the degradation of any potential toxic constitutes; however, manure management practices often neglect soil biodiversity. Financiado para publicaci\u00f3n en acceso aberto: Universidade de Vigo/CISUG OBJECTIVE: In this review, we explored the impact of manure from farmed animals on soil biodiversity by considering factors that determine the effects of manure and vice versa. By evaluating manure's potential to enhance soil biodiversity, but also its environmental risks, we assessed current and future EU policy and legislations with the ultimate aim of providing recommendations that can enable a more sustainable management of farm manures.","id":"10.1016/j.agsy.2021.103251"}
{"text":"Abstract   Water and nitrogen surpluses are major concern for the new intensive olive groves in South of Portugal. In this study, field measurements were integrated with a system model, Root Zone Water Quality Model (RZWQM2) to assess the sustainability and environmental impact of fertigation in an intensive olive grove (Olea europaea L. var. Arbequina). The model provided acceptable predictions of evapotranspiration, soil moisture and nitrate contents. Based on model simulations, under current fertigation practices, 57% of the irrigation applied was lost via drainage, while 71% and 5% of fertilizer N inputs were lost through leaching and denitrification, respectively. The non-fertilizer N input from soil organic matter (OM) satisfied 64% of the crop N needs. The tested model was used to predict the impacts of a full irrigation (FIFC) and two regulated deficit irrigation schemes (RDI75, RDI50) on drainage and N leaching. In FIFC the atmospheric demand was met while the application frequency maintained the water storage below the soil field capacity. In RDI75 and RDI50 the irrigation application amount between stone hardening and onset of ripening was 75 and 50% of FIFC respectively.  Compared with the current practice, the FIFC decreased drainage and N leaching by 47% and 90% respectively, while maintaining the actual evapotranspiration (ETa). The RDI75 seems to be the most adequate for the studied agro-system since, in relation to the FIFC, it saved 13% of irrigation water with only 5% decrease in ETa. Furthermore, the 15% reduction in leaching, together with the 19% increase in soil OM mineralization optimized the trees N uptake. The study of three different N application rates for each irrigation scenario indicated that, to minimize residual storage, N should be applied according to plant needs, by using a real-time indicator based upon foliar analysis or the chlorophyll meter measurements.","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2014.09.007"}

In this study, two edible coatings based on Aloe vera gel (AV) and sodium alginate cross-linked with calcium lactate (AC), with the addition of 10 mg/mL ferulic acid (FA) as a functional ingredient, were developed in order to prolong the quality and safety of fresh-cut apple discs. Texture parameters, pH and Brix values and water activity did not undergo relevant changes related to the treatments. Except for weight loss, which was significantly lower for the coated samples, the addition of FA was found to be the most relevant factor for the other investigated parameters, including the total phenolic content and the antioxidant activity measured by ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP). Browning was delayed by the addition of FA and also by the AV coating, while non-coated and alginate coated samples showed the highest values in early stages. Although no effect on Saccharomyces cerevisiae was observed, FA treatments and alginate were effective in reducing Listeria monocytogenes populations by 2.3 \u00b1 0.4 log CFU / g, which contributes to an enhanced product safety. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion","id":"10.1016/j.fpsl.2020.100620"}

{"text":"Open AccessPeer reviewed Despite the social concern about the generalization of antibiotic resistance hotspots worldwide, very little is known about the contribution of different potential sources to the global risk. Here we present a quantitative analysis of the distribution of Antibiotic Resistance Genes (ARGs) in soil, rhizospheric soil, roots, leaves and beans in tomato, lettuce and broad beans crops (165 samples in total), grown in nine commercial plots distributed in four geographical zones in the vicinity of Barcelona (North East Spain). We also analyzed five soil samples from a nearby forest, with no record of agricultural activities. DNA samples were analyzed for their content in the ARGs sul1, tetM, qnrS1, blaCTX-M-32, blaOXA-58, mecA, and blaTEM, plus the integron intI1, using qPCR methods. In addition, soil microbiomes from the different plots were analyzed by amplicon-targeted 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Our data show a decreasing gradient of ARG loads from soil to fruits and beans, the latter showing only from 0.1 to 0.01% of the abundance values in soil. The type of crop was the main determinant for both ARG distribution and microbiome composition among the different plots, with minor contributions of geographic location and irrigation water source. We propose that soil amendment and/or fertilization, more than irrigation water, are the main drivers of ARG loads on the edible parts of the crop, and that they should therefore be specifically controlled. \u00a9 2019 Elsevier Inc.

{"text":"<jats:p>Abstract. Climate reanalyses provide a plethora of global atmospheric and surface parameters in a consistent manner over multi-decadal timescales. Hence, they are widely used in many fields, and an in-depth evaluation of the different variables provided by reanalyses is a necessary means to provide feedback on the quality to their users and the operational centres producing these data sets, and to help guide their development. Recently, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) released the new state-of-the-art climate reanalysis ERA5, following up on its popular predecessor ERA-Interim. Different sets of variables from ERA5 were already evaluated in a handful of studies, but so far, the quality of land-surface energy partitioning has not been assessed. Here, we evaluate the surface energy partitioning over land in ERA5 and concentrate on the appraisal of the surface latent heat flux, surface sensible heat flux, and Bowen ratio against different reference data sets and using different modelling tools. Most of our analyses point towards a better quality of surface energy partitioning in ERA5 than in ERA-Interim, which may be attributed to a better representation of land-surface processes in ERA5 and certainly to the better quality of near-surface meteorological variables. One of the key shortcomings of the reanalyses identified in our study is the overestimation of the surface latent heat flux over land, which \u2013 although substantially lower than in ERA-Interim \u2013 still remains in ERA5. Overall, our results indicate the high quality of the surface turbulent fluxes from ERA5 and the general improvement upon ERA-Interim, thereby endorsing the efforts of ECMWF to improve their climate reanalysis and to provide useful data to many scientific and operational fields.                     </jats:p>","id":"10.5194/gmd-13-4159-2020"}

{"text":"<p>Dryland regions are characterised by water scarcity and are facing major challenges under climate change. One difficulty is anticipating how rainfall will be partitioned into evaporative losses, groundwater, soil moisture, and runoff (the water balance) in the future, which has important implications for water resources and dryland ecosystems. However, in order to effectively estimate the water balance, hydrological models in drylands need to capture the key processes at the appropriate spatio-temporal scales. These include spatially restricted and temporally brief rainfall, high evaporation rates, transmission losses, and focused groundwater recharge. Lack of available input and evaluation data and the high computational costs of explicit representation of ephemeral surface\u2013groundwater interactions restrict the usefulness of most hydrological models in these environments. Therefore, here we have developed a parsimonious distributed hydrological model for DRYland Partitioning (DRYP). The DRYP model incorporates the key processes of water partitioning in dryland regions with limited data requirements, and we tested it in the data-rich Walnut Gulch Experimental Watershed against measurements of streamflow, soil moisture, and evapotranspiration. Overall, DRYP showed skill in quantifying the main components of the dryland water balance including monthly observations of streamflow (Nash\u2013Sutcliffe efficiency, NSE, <span class='inline-formula'>\u223c</span>\u20090.7), evapotranspiration (NSE\u2009<span class='inline-formula'><i>&gt;</i></span>\u20090.6), and soil moisture (NSE\u2009<span class='inline-formula'>\u223c</span>\u20090.7).

{"text":"Abstract   In this study rare earth elements (REE) signatures (REE ratios, cerium and europium anomalies) are applied to a complex soil stratigraphic sequence from the site of Konso, Ethiopia, with the aim of determining whether REE can distinguish the strata observed in the field. Forty soil samples were taken from a depositional sequence that includes overlapping human induced and \u2018natural\u2019 erosional and depositional processes. The samples were analysed by Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) to determine trace elements and REE, with concentrations of major elements determined using X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Cluster Analyses (CA) were used to observe differences between strata. The mechanisms that influenced REE values and fractionations were related to OM accumulation, pyrogenic SOM, redox and secondary CaCO3 precipitation, suggesting the addition of proxies to the REE, Sc and Y data processing. This produced a clustering of samples that more accurately reflected the stratigraphic field observations. It is expected that this approach, combining the analysis of REE concentrations with an understanding of the mechanisms driving them in a given site or profile, will be replicable for other stratigraphic sequences. The results demonstrate that REE signatures are not just able to detect stratigraphic differences defined through field observations but also highlight variations within the same deposits. REE analysis could therefore become a powerful geoarchaeological tool, even for studies of complex stratigraphies.","id":"10.1016/j.microc.2019.05.050"}
{"text":"Abstract   To enhance crop productivity and minimize the harmful effects of various environmental stresses, such as salinity and drought, farmers often use mineral fertilizers. However, inadequate or excessive fertilization can reduce plant growth and nutritive quality and contribute to soil degradation and environmental pollution. This study investigated the effects of salinity (0, 100 or 150\u202fmM NaCl) and nitrogen form (sole NO3\u2212 or NH4+, or combined NO3\u2212:NH4+ at 25:75 or 50:50) on growth, photosynthesis, and water and ion status of a commercial variety of maize (Zea mays SY Sincero). In the absence of NaCl, the media containing ammonium only or both nitrogen forms had higher aboveground growth rates than that containing nitrate only. Indeed, the maize growth, expressed as leaf dry matter, seen on NH4+ in the absence of salinity, was nearly double the biomass compared to that with NO3\u2212treatment. Irrespective of N form, the presence of NaCl severely reduced leaf and roots growth; the presence of ammonium in the nutrient solution diminished these negative effects. Compared to the NH4+ only and combined treatments, the leaves of plants in the NO3\u2212-only medium showed signs of nitrogen deficiency (general chlorosis), which was more pronounced in the lower than upper leaves, indicating that nitrate is partly replaced by chloride during root uptake. NH4+ favored maize growth more than NO3\u2212, especially when exposed to saline conditions, and may improve the plant's capacity to osmotically adjust to salinity by accumulating inorganic solutes.","id":"10.1016/j.plaphy.2019.03.005"}

{"text":"Abstract   Methodologies based on earth observation remote sensing allow for a precise estimation of actual water requirements for irrigated crops across large areas. In spite of the many number of experiments using or analyzing the relationship between the basal crop coefficient (Kcb) and the soil adjusted vegetation index (SAVI) for maize, the development of new maize hybrid varieties with modifications related to canopy architecture suggest a possible change of the leaf area index (LAI) for maximum Kcb and its relationship with the SAVI or other vegetation indices. In addition, we noted a lack of analysis of these relationships for cultivated soybean. The objective of this paper is to analyze the Kcb, SAVI and LAI relationships in maize and soybean based on the non-linear relationships proposed by Choudhury et al. (1994). In addition, we propose a modification of the Choudhury et al. (1994) approach based on field-based experimental evidence of a minimum Kcb greater than 0. For sites with limited field data, we also analyze the utility of a simple linear regression based on the Kcb and SAVI values for bare soil and maximum Kcb values. The resulting Kcb-SAVI relationships are assimilated into a remote sensing based soil water balance model. The results of the model are analyzed in terms of irrigation requirements and crop evapotranspiration (ETa) for 11 growing seasons in two fields cultivated with irrigated and rain-fed maize and soybean in eastern Nebraska. Comparisons of measured and modelled ETa values indicate a good agreement, with RMSE lower than 0.7\u00a0mm\u00a0d\u22121 for weekly averaged values. The comparison of actual irrigation applied and irrigation requirements indicate the central pivot systems could not supply adequate water in some growing seasons with higher demands.","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2017.03.022"}

El art\u00edculo esta en libre acceso en la revista.-- free access article in this review Very little is known about how variation in environmental conditions alters the strength and the structure of competitive networks and what are the consequences of this for species coexistence. We performed a competition experiment with 10 annual plant species to parameterise a population model describing species\u2019 dynamics according to their vital rates and pairwise competitive coefficients. Seeds from all species were sown under two different climatic scenarios: (1) right before the first major storm of the growing season and (2) after an imposed fall drought of 2 months simulating an extreme climatic event of intense aridity. Species\u2019 demography and competitive responses were used to estimate pairwise stabilising niche differences and average fitness differences. In addition, we used tools from network theory to characterise the structure of multispecies competition from the determinants of species coexistence. Specifically, we evaluated changes in competitive dominance between species pairs, and the prevalence of intransitive competitive relationships for 120 triplets between these two climatic events. The experimental extreme event significantly reduced fitness differences between species pairs. Such an equalising mechanism promotes coexistence. However, niche differences were also reduced in such a way that the number of species pairs whose niche differences overcame their fitness differences was reduced from six to two. Contrary to our expectations, the extreme event did not increase the hierarchy of competitive dominance. Instead, and depending on the technique used, the prevalence of intransitivity remained marginally similar (17% to 22%) or significantly increased from 19.4% to 29.8%. This pattern was likely a consequence of the significant changes in competitive dominance between species pairs (26 changes out of 45; 58%). Although fitness differences were equalised and intransitive competition promoted, our model predicted a lower likelihood of coexistence under the extreme event for both species pairs and triplets, mainly because competitive interactions did not promote enough niche differences to balance the observed fitness asymmetries in our competitive networks. Synthesis. We empirically proved that an extreme climate results in communities with reduced niche and fitness differences in which species are less likely to coexist despite the increasing prevalence of intransitive competition.

The central conclusion of the theory is that coexistence at local scales depends on two opposing forces: average fitness differences between species, which drive the best-adapted species to exclude others, and stabilizing mechanisms, which promote diversity via niche differentiation. Recent theoretical work has focussed on how interactions between plants and other organisms influence the equalizing and stabilizing forces. However, there is a lack of empirical information. Therefore, the next fundamental step is to assess the prevalence of these mechanisms for controlling plant coexistence across a wide range of interactions and systems. To that end, this special feature presents 10 theoretical, observational, or manipulative studies illustrating 9 different biotic interactions including mutualisms (pollinators, seed dispersers, soil microbes, and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi) and antagonisms (leaf and seed herbivores, and leaf and root pathogens). All studies share a common question: how biotic interactions regulate plant coexistence? Comparisons across studies suggest that biotic interactions modify both stabilizing and average fitness differences. In those cases where biotic interactions promote stable coexistence between plant species, both mutualistic and antagonistic interactions act more frequently as an equalizing rather than as a stabilizing mechanisms. Besides these generalities, the studies of this special issue also present novel theoretical and empirical approaches to better understand the maintenance of species diversity over a wide variety of systems, environmental conditions, and organisms. Synthesis. The studies presented here constitutes a solid base to empirically explore how mutualistic and antagonistic interactions act upon the determinants of plant species competition, and open novel paths for future research. Collectively, these advances will serve to pave the road for a better theoretical and empirical understanding of how biotic interactions control biodiversity","id":"10.1111/1365-2745.13040"}
{"text":"Abstract   The present work aims to develop a simple approach relating normalized daily sap flow (liters per unit of leaf area) and daily reference evapotranspiration (ET 0 ) (mm/day). Two methods (FAO-Penman-Monteith (FAO-PM) and Hargreaves-Samani (HARG)) of the calculation of ET 0  were tested in order to examine their impact on the established relationships. The data sets used for developing this approach are taken over well irrigated orchards from three experimental sites (olive trees, cv. \u201c Olea europaea L .\u201d, olive trees, cv. \u201c Arbequino \u201d and citrus trees cv. \u201c Clementine Afourar \u201d) conducted in the Tensift region around Marrakech (center of Morocco) and one experimental site (pecan orchard, cv. \u201c Carya illinoinensis, Wangenh. K. Koch\u201d ) conducted in the Yaqui Valley, northwest of Mexico).  The results showed that the normalized daily sap flow was linearly correlated with ET 0  (mm per day) calculated by FAO-PM method. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) and the slope of this linear regression varied between 0.71 and 0.97 and between 0.30 and 0.35, respectively, depending on the type of orchards. For HARG method, the relationship between both terms is also linear but with more discrepancy (R 2 \u00a0=\u00a00.7). This was somehow expected since this method is known to underestimate ET 0  values in the semi-arid areas. Afterward, the validation of the developed linear relationship was performed over an olive orchard (\u201c Olea europaea L .\u201d) where the measurements of sap flow were available for another cropping season (2004). The scatter plot between the normalized measured and estimated sap flow based on FAO-PM method reveals a very good agreement (slope\u00a0=\u00a01, and RMSE\u00a0=\u00a00.14\u00a0L/m 2  leaf area). However, for the estimation of normalized sap flow based on HARG method, the correlation is relatively more scattered (slope\u00a0=\u00a00.95, and RMSE\u00a0=\u00a00.35\u00a0L/m 2  leaf area). A further validation was performed using the measurements of evapotranspiration (ET) by eddy correlation system and the results showed that the correlation between normalized measured ET and estimated normalized sap flow is best when using FAO-PM method (RMSE\u00a0=\u00a00.33\u00a0L/m 2  leaf area) for estimating ET 0  than when using HARG method (RMSE\u00a0=\u00a00.51\u00a0L/m 2  leaf area).  Finally, the performance of the developed approach was compared to the traditional dual crop coefficient scheme for estimating plant transpiration. Cross-comparison of these two approaches with the measurements data gave satisfactory results with an average value of RMSE equal to about 0.37\u00a0mm/day for both approaches.","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2017.04.005"}
{"text":"Abstract   The main objective of this study was to evaluate the performance and the domain of validity of the two-source energy balance model (TSEB) for the monitoring of actual evapotranspiration ( ET a  ) as a first step towards its use for irrigation planning. Secondary objectives were to analyze the ability of TSEB model to detect water stress and to evaluate evapotranspiration partition between evaporation (E) and transpiration (T) over irrigated annual crops. Within this context, TSEB was compared to the calibrated FAO-56 dual approach, taken as a reference tool for the monitoring of crop water consumption. TSEB computes  ET a   as the residual of a double component energy balance driven by the radiative surface temperature ( T s  ) used as a proxy of crop hydric conditions; the FAO-56 dual crop coefficient approach uses the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) as a proxy of Basal Crop Coefficient ( K cb  ) and assesses the hydric status directly by solving a two layer soil water budget. Both approaches were evaluated over four plots of wheat and sugar beet located in the Haouz plain (Marrakech, Morocco) that were instrumented with eddy covariance systems during the 2012 and 2013 growing seasons. Series of ASTER images were acquired during the first agricultural season. Both models offered fair performances compared to  ET a   observations with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) lower than 1\u00a0mm\u00a0day \u22121  apart from the FAO-56 dual approach on the sugar beet plot because of uncertain irrigation inputs. This highlights a major weakness of this model when water inputs are uncertain; a very likely case at the plot scale. By contrast, the TSEB model offered smoother performances in all cases. The potentialities of both approaches to predict a water stress index based on the departure from potential evapotranspiration ( ET  c ) was evaluated: although the FAO-56 dual was better suited to detect high water stresses, the TSEB model was able to detect moderate stresses without a need to prescribe water inputs. Finally, the partition of  ET a   between soil evaporation and plant transpiration was estimated indirectly by confrontation between simulated soil evaporation and surface (0\u20135\u00a0cm) soil moisture acquired spatially with Theta Probe sensors and taken as a proxy of soil evaporation. TSEB evaporation was well correlated to surface soil moisture (r\u00a0=\u00a00.82) for low Leaf Area Index (LAI) values ( 2 \u00a0m \u22122 ). In addition, TSEB predicted partition compared well to snapshot measurements based on the stable isotope method. This in-depth comparison of two simple tools to monitor  ET a   leads us to the conclusion that the TSEB model can reasonably be used to map  ET a   on large scale and possibly for the decision-making process of irrigation scheduling.","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2017.08.007"}
{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience The FAO-56 dual crop coefficient (FAO-2Kc) model has been extensively used at the field scale to estimate the crop water requirements by means of the simulated evapotranspiration (ET) and its two components evaporation (E) and transpiration (T). Given that the main limitation of FAO-2Kc for operational irrigation management over large areas is the unavailability (over most irrigated areas) of irrigation data, this study investigates the feasibility 1) to constrain the FAO-2Kc ET from LST and VI data, 2) to retrieve irrigation amounts and dates from LST and VI data and 3) to estimate the root-zone soil moisture (RZSM) at the daily scale. In practice, the vegetation and soil temperatures retrieved from LST/VI data are used to estimate the FAO-2Kc vegetation stress coefficient (Ks) and soil evaporation reduction coefficient (Kr), respectively. The modeling and remote sensing combined approach is tested over a wheat crop field in central Morocco, and results are evaluated in terms of ET, irrigation and RZSM estimates. ET is estimated with a RMSE of 0.68 mm day-1 compared to 0.84 mm day-1 for the standard (without using LST data) FAO-2Kc based on tabulated values for the parameters. The total irrigation depth (67 mm) is correctly estimated and is very close to the actual effective irrigation (69.8 mm) applied by the farmer. Daily RZSM is estimated with an R2 value of 0.68 (0.42) and a RMSE value of 0.034 (0.061) m3 m-3 by forcing FAO-2Kc using the retrieved irrigation (from LST-derived estimates and precipitation only). Since spaceborne LST data are currently not available at both high-spatial and high-temporal resolution, a sensitivity analysis is finally undertaken to assess the potential and applicability of the proposed methodology to temporally sparse thermal data.","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2018.06.014"}

The aim of this experiment was to screen a large tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) collection cultivated under well-watered and water deficit conditions, in order to identify those genotypes with the best performance under water shortage. Thus, 165 tomato genotypes including different cultivars (landraces and modern genotypes) and fruit types (processing, big size, long shelf-life and cherry) were grown in open field under two different cultivation regimes: well-watered (WW, covering 100% crop evapotranspiration demands) and water deficit (WD, irrigation stopped one month after field transplantation). Several leaf-level traits, yield and fruit quality were measured. Large variability was found under WW, with 20-fold variations in yield among genotypes. No differences in yield or fruit quality traits were found between modern genotypes and landraces, while differences in these parameters were observed based on the fruit type. Water deficit affected the observed variability, with a general decrease of yield and increases of fruit quality. Cluster analysis based on fruit traits placed several landraces in the same cluster that the most productive modern genotypes, irrespective of the water treatment. Variable responses to WD were observed, depending on the fruit or cultivar type. Carbon isotope composition was positively correlated with leaf nitrogen content, and determined the yield limit under both treatments. The results of this study highlight the potential of landraces for minimizing yield reduction under WD and increasing fruit quality, having similar or even better performance as compared to modern improved genotypes.","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2019.105722"}

Additionally, \u2018infinitely\u2019 old samples found not to be in laboratory saturation were reported. We present single and multi-grain SAR-OSL investigations for a coarse-grained (180\u2013250 \u03bcm) quartz sample extracted from loess collected below the Brunhes/Matuyama transition at the Roksolany site (Ukraine). The sample was dated to more than 1000 ka by electron spin resonance using a multi center approach (Al and Ti signals), confirming that the D<sub>e</sub> (\u223c2000 Gy) falls beyond the limit of standard OSL D<sub>e</sub> measurement techniques. However, the natural signal measured using multi-grain aliquots of quartz was found to be below the laboratory saturation level. A comparison was made between synthetic dose response curves (DRCs) generated from single-grain and multi-grain aliquot data, respectively; the natural signal was found to be closer to the latoratory saturation level (92%) in the case of the single-grain synthetic DRC than for the multi-grain synthetic DRC where the signal was 86% of the saturation level. This difference could not be attributed to stimulation with different wavelengths, i.e. blue and green light stimulation for multi and single-grain measurements, respectively. By analysing synthetic data obtained by grouping grains according to their brightness, it was observed that brighter grains give a natural signal closer to the laboratory saturation level. This trend was confirmed for multi-grain aliquot data. Based on these findings we infer that variability in the contribution from populations of grains with different levels of brightness may represent a controlling factor in the closeness of the natural signal to laboratory saturation level for infinitely old samples.</p>","id":"10.1016/j.radmeas.2018.06.008"}
{"text":"Abstract   Phosphorus fertilisation is crucial for crop yields. However, traditional phosphate resources are dwindling, thus a more efficient use of phosphorus fertilisers is required for sustainable farming. This study demonstrates the scope of image-based models parameterised by elemental maps by assessing how a dynamic root system architecture may improve phosphorus root uptake from a fertiliser pellet. A multi-image based modelling method was developed by utilising structural imaging coupled with elemental maps. Structural imaging was used to capture barley (Hordeum vulgare L. cv. Optic) root, soil and fertiliser pellet configurations as a domain for numerical simulations. Elemental mapping was used to image phosphorus in soil thin-sections of the same samples. These two imaging modes were aligned using an automated method and image-based models describing the diffusion and root-uptake of phosphorus in soil were parametrised using the elemental maps. Structural imaging showed root length density was increased inside and near the fertiliser pellet. Averaging elemental data revealed phosphorus gradients from the pellet. Modelling results suggested: the pellet only enhances phosphorus uptake of roots within 2\u202fmm over 30 days, densely packed roots decrease phosphorus uptake efficiency, and a root system that responded to nutrients from a fertiliser have comparatively increased phosphorus uptake efficiency near the pellet. The combination of structural and elemental imaging provides the means to accurately parameterise both the geometric and chemical aspects of models describing phosphorus movement in root-soil-fertiliser systems. This approach may be applicable to other plant-soil systems where structure and elemental quantities are important to the problem.","id":"10.1016/j.rhisph.2019.100152"}
{"text":"Open AccessThe remotely sensed land surface temperature (LST) is a key parameter to monitor surface energy and water fluxes but the strong impact of topography on LST has limited its use to mostly flat areas. To fill the gap, this study proposes a physically-based method to normalize LST data for topographic-namely illumination and elevation-effects over mountainous areas. Both topographic effects are first quantified by inverting a dual-source soil/vegetation energy balance (EB) model forced by 1) the instantaneous solar radiation simulated by a 3D radiative transfer model named DART (Discrete Anisotropic Radiative Transfer) that uses a digital elevation model (DEM), 2) a satellite-derived vegetation index, and 3) local meteorological (air temperature, air relative humidity and wind speed) data available at a given location. The satellite LST is then normalized for topography by simulating the LST using both pixel-and image-scale DART solar radiation and elevation data. The approach is tested on three ASTER (Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer) overpass dates over a steep-sided 6 km by 6 km area in the Atlas Mountain in Morocco. The mean correlation coefficient and root mean square difference (RMSD) between EB-simulated and ASTER LST is 0.80 and 3 \u2022 C, respectively. Moreover, the EB-based method is found to be more accurate than a more classical approach based on a multi-linear regression with DART solar radiation and elevation data. The EB-simulated LST is also evaluated against an extensive ground dataset of 135 autonomous 1-cm depth temperature sensors deployed over the study area. While the mean RMSD between 90 m resolution ASTER LST and localized ibutton measurements is 6.1 \u2022 C, the RMSD between EB-simulated LST and ibut-ton soil temperature is 5.4 and 5.3 \u2022 C for a DEM at 90 m and 8 m resolution, respectively. The proposed topographic normalization is self-calibrated from (LST, DEM, vegetation index and in situ meteorological data) data available over large extents. As a significant perspective this approach opens the path to using normalized LST as input to evapotranspiration retrieval methods based on LST.

{"text":"Abstract   The Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE) and its revised version (RUSLE) are often used to estimate soil erosion at regional landscape scales. USLE/RUSLE contain parameters for slope length factor (L) and slope steepness factor (S), usually combined as LS. However a major limitation is the difficulty in extracting the LS factor. Methods to estimate LS based on geographic information systems have been developed in the last two decades. L can be calculated for large watersheds using the unit contributing area (UCA) or the slope length (\u03bb) as input parameters. Due to the absence of an estimation of slope length, the UCA method is insufficiently accurate. Improvement of the spatial accuracy of slope length and LS factor is still necessary for estimating soil erosion. The purpose of this study was to develop an improved method to estimate the slope length and LS factor. We combined the algorithm for multiple-flow direction (MFD) used in the UCA method with the LS-TOOL (LS-TOOLSFD) algorithms, taking into account the calculation errors and cutoff conditions for distance, to obtain slope length (\u03bb) and the LS factor. The new method, LS-TOOLMFD, was applied and validated in a catchment with complexly variable slopes. The slope length and LS calculated by LS-TOOLMFD both agreed better with field data than with the calculations using the LS-TOOLSFD and UCA methods, respectively. We then integrated the LS-TOOLMFD algorithm into LS-TOOL developed in Microsoft's .NET environment using C# with a user-friendly interface. The method can automatically calculate slope length, slope steepness, L, S, and LS factor, providing the results as ASCII files that can be easily used in GIS software and erosion models. This study is an important step forward in conducting accurate large-scale erosion evaluation.","id":"10.1016/j.geoderma.2017.08.006"}
{"text":"Open AccessRadar data have been used to retrieve and monitor the surface soil moisture (SM) changes in various conditions. However, the calibration of radar models whether empirically or physically-based, is still subject to large uncertainties especially at high-spatial resolution. To help calibrate radar-based retrieval approaches to supervising SM at high resolution, this paper presents an innovative synergistic method combining Sentinel-1 (S1) microwave and Landsat-7/8 (L7/8) thermal data. First, the S1 backscatter coefficient was normalized by its maximum and minimum values obtained during 2015\u20132016 agriculture season. Second, the normalized S1 backscatter coefficient was calibrated from reference points provided by a thermal-derived SM proxy named soil evaporative efficiency (SEE, defined as the ratio of actual to potential soil evaporation). SEE was estimated as the radiometric soil temperature normalized by its minimum and maximum values reached in a water-saturated and dry soil, respectively. We estimated both soil temperature endmembers by using a soil energy balance model forced by available meteorological forcing. The proposed approach was evaluated against in situ SM measurements collected over three bare soil fields in a semi-arid region in Morocco and we compared it against a classical approach based on radar data only. The two polarizations VV (vertical transmit and receive) and VH (vertical transmit and horizontal receive) of the S1 data available over the area are tested to analyse the sensitivity of radar signal to SM at high incidence angles (39\u00b0\u201343\u00b0). We found that the VV polarization was better correlated to SM than the VH polarization with a determination coefficient of 0.47 and 0.28, respectively.

{"text":"Abstract   Various thermochemical conversion technologies can be applied in producing biochar from a wide range of raw materials. We studied the chemical quality of 10 different biochars produced via torrefaction (TOR), slow pyrolysis (SP), or hydrothermal carbonization (HTC), in order to assess their potential in improving clay soil aggregate stability and thus contribute to mitigation of erosion from agricultural soils. X-ray tomography was used to visualize soil aggregates in some selected biochar treatments.  Feedstock type had a major influence on the properties of the biochar, but in general biochars derived through SP were alkaline and exhibited higher electrical conductivity and ash content and lower surface activity than acidic HTC and TOR biochars. Alkyl peak areas determined from FTIR spectra were higher in biochars produced by TOR and HTC than in SP biochars, which indicates a higher degree of hydrophobicity in the former. Significantly higher aggregate stability and reduced colloid detachment were achieved with HTC biochars, most likely due to hydrophobicity reducing wetting rate and aggregate slaking.  When mixed with initially aggregated soil, the biochar particles settled in inter-aggregate voids. According to image analysis, the internal porosity of soil aggregates was not affected by biochar addition, i.e., biochar did not enter the aggregates during the short incubation period. Addition of hydrophobic HTC biochar decreased the soil water content at field capacity, whereas more inert SP chars tended to increase it. The overall effect of biochar hydrophobicity on soil functions needs to be explored prior to wider use of biochar as a soil amendment.","id":"10.1016/j.geoderma.2019.02.028"}

Recently, visible-near- infrared (Vis-NIR) and X-ray-fluorescence (XRF) have emerged as efficient and inexpensive proximal soil sensing (PSS) methods for assessment of soil attributes in support of PA applications. The goal of this study was to explore the potential of data fusion in accuracy improvement of predicting key soil attributes using Vis-NIR and XRF spectra. More specifically, local weighted regression (LWR) and partial least squares (PLS) regression methods were examined and compared in prediction of the following soil attributes: pH, organic carbon (OC), phosphorous (P), magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), and sodium (Na). Besides the individual-sensor models, we evaluated three data fusion approaches basedon spectra fusion (SF). The first method concatenates the full Vis-NIR and XRF spectra before PLS (SF1-PLS). In the second SF approach (SF2-PLS), the concatenation of the principal components (PCs) of the two spectra types \u2013 each resulted from a principal component analysis (PCA) \u2013 were used as input to PLS. The last proposed method, SF-CNN, uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) with input in form of a matrix whose columns are the PCs of the Vis-NIR and the PCs of the XRF spectra. To evaluate the proposed methods, a total 267 soil samples of nine arable fields were collected and scanned in laboratory settings using a Vis-NIR and an XRF spectrometer. For each soil attribute, the samples of six fields were used as the calibration set while the samples of the remaining three fields were used for validating the prediction models. The individual-sensor and SF models were evaluated in terms of ratio of performance to inter-quartile (RPIQ), root mean square error (RMSE), and Lin\u2019s concordance correlation coefficient (LCCC). The validation results showed that PLS generally outperforms LWR. Also, the prediction accuracy obtained from Vis-NIR spectra was better than that of XRF for all the attributes, except for Ca. The proposed SF schemes, especially the SF-CNN, outperformed the individual models in the prediction of all attributes, except P and Ca. The best improvement of the prediction results, compared to the individual-sensor models, was obtained for Mg (RPIQ\u00a0=\u00a01.60, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a06.88\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g, LCCC\u00a0=\u00a00.93), successively followed by pH (RPIQ\u00a0=\u00a02.52, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a00.36, LCCC\u00a0=\u00a00.68), and Na (RPIQ\u00a0=\u00a01.69, RMSE\u00a0=\u00a02.55\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g, LCCC\u00a0=\u00a00.65).

Nitrate can be cathodically reduced in bioelectrochemical systems using autotrophic denitrifiers with low energy investment and without chemical addition. Successful denitrification was demonstrated in previous studies in both microbial fuel cells and microbial electrolysis cells (MECs) with continuous current flow, whereas the impact of intermittent current supply (e.g., in a fluidized-bed system) on denitrification and particularly the electron-storing capacity of the denitrifying electroactive biofilms (EABs) on the cathodes have not been studied in depth. In this study, two continuously fed MECs were operated in parallel under continuous and periodic polarization modes over 280 days, respectively. Under continuous polarization, the maximum denitrification rate reached 233 g NO3--N/m(3)/d with 98% nitrate removal (0.6 mg NO3--N/L in the effluent) with negligible intermediate production, while under a 30 s open-circuit/30 s polarization mode, 86% of nitrate was removed at a maximum rate of 205 g NO3--N/m(3)/d (4.5 mg NO3--N/L in the effluent) with higher N2O production (6.6-9.3 mg N/L in the effluent). Conversely, periodic polarization could be an interesting approach in other bioelectrochemical processes if the generation of chemical intermediates (partially reduced or oxidized) should be favored. Similar microbial communities dominated byGallionellaceaewere found in both MECs; however, swapping the polarization modes and the electrochemical analyses suggested that the periodically polarized EABs probably developed a higher ability for electron storage and transfer, which supported the direct electron transfer pathway in discontinuous operation or fluidized biocathodes.","id":"10.1021/acs.est.1c03586"}

This cotransport was more intense in the presence of larger pores (12 \u03bcm) and strong chemoeffectors (\u03b3-aminobutyric acid). The mechanism that governed cotransport at the cell scale involved mechanical pushing and hydrodynamic interactions. Chemotaxis-mediated cotransport of bacterial degraders and its implications in pore accessibility opens new avenues for the enhancement of bacterial dispersion in porous media and the biodegradation of heterogeneously contaminated scenarios.

It also accumulated in aerobically incubated soil from two additional PAH-contaminated sites and was formed from pyrene by two pyrene-degrading bacterial cultures known to be geographically widespread, underscoring its potential environmental significance.","id":"10.1021/acs.est.7b01172"}
{"text":"Closed Access[EN] Transpiration (7) returns about half of continental precipitation back into the atmosphere. However, the global spatial and temporal dynamics of transpiration are highly uncertain, and current estimates rely on either indirect remote sensing or empirical model formulations. Here, we show that T can be estimated reliably at the global scale using observations of plant sun-induced fluorescence (SIF). To do so, we derive T using two different methods from globally-distributed eddy-covariance measurements and compare it with satellite SIF retrievals from GOME-2 and OCO-2. Whereas most research to date has focused on the link between SIF and gross primary production (GPP), we demonstrate that SIF is as highly correlated with T (mean correlation coefficient R of 0.76 across sites for 16-day periods with GOME-2 and 0.75 at the daily scale with OCO-2). SIF shows a greater predictive skill to estimate T than traditional optical vegetation indices and its dynamics are very similar to those of T. Through the use of an advanced radiative transfer model, we also demonstrate a clear empirical link between SIF and T. At 83 FLUXNET sites, remote sensing data and flux-derived GPP and T are used to estimate the relevant parameters of the Soil Canopy Observation of Photosynthesis and Energy fluxes (SCOPE) radiative transfer model and to model SIF. While the relationship between SIF and photosynthesis (GPP) is mostly controlled by leaf biochemical properties and plant structure, the SIF-T relationship appears largely determined by air temperature and intrinsic water use efficiency. Our findings suggest that ongoing advances in satellite SIF retrievals will allow for a more direct estimation of transpiration over large scales This study was funded by the Belgian Science Policy Office (BELSPO) in the frame of the STEREO III program project STR3S (SR/02/329).

{"text":"Sandy soils occupy large area in Poland (about 50%) and in the world. This study aimed at determining spatial relationships of cereal yields and the selected soil physical and chemical properties in three study years (2001-2003) on low productive sandy Podzol soil (Podlasie, Poland). The yields and soil properties in plough and subsoil layers were determined at 72-150 points. The test crops were: wheat, wheat and barley mixture and oats. To explore the spatial relationship between cereal yields and each soil property spatial statistics was used. The best fitting models were adjusted to empirical semivariance and cross-semivariance, which were used to draw maps using kriging. Majority of the soil properties and crop yields exhibited low and medium variability (coefficient of variation 5-70%). The effective ranges of the spatial dependence (the distance at which data are autocorrelated) for yields and all soil properties were 24.3-58.5m and 10.5-373m, respectively. Nugget to sill ratios showed that crop yields and soil properties were strongly spatially dependent except bulk density. Majority of the pairs in cross-semivariograms exhibited strong spatial interdependence. The ranges of the spatial dependence varied in plough layer between 54.6m for yield\u00d7pH up to 2433m for yield\u00d7silt content. Corresponding ranges in subsoil were 24.8m for crop yield\u00d7clay content in 2003 and 1404m for yield\u00d7bulk density. Kriging maps allowed separating sub-field area with the lowest yield and soil cation exchange capacity, organic carbon content and pH. This area had lighter color on the aerial photograph due to high content of the sand and low content of soil organic carbon. The results will help farmers at identifying sub-field areas for applying localized management practices to improve these soil properties and further spatial studies in larger scale.","id":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.277"}

The study resulted in a peer-reviewed scientific paper published in Geoderma \u201cLand-use- and climate-mediated variations in soil bacterial and fungal biomass across Europe and their driving factors\u201d.\nThe objectives of this study were (i) quantifying and comparing bacterial (including Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and Actinobacteria) and fungal biomass in soils from croplands, grasslands, and forests located across Europe and belonging to three broad climate types: cold, temperate, and arid; (ii) modeling the factors controlling soil bacterial and fungal biomass under contrasting land uses and climates; and (iii) investigating levels of bacterial and fungal biomass in cropland soils cultivated with three important crop types in Europe: cereals, oil-producing crops, and woody orchards. Contents of soil microbial biomass were investigated through the analysis of fatty acid methyl esters (FAME). Soil and climate data were obtained from the same LUCAS 2018 survey and online databases and were used as predictors of bacterial and fungal biomass. Random forest, regression analyses and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to explore the main drivers of soil microbial biomass.\nBacterial biomass decreased with land use in the following order: grasslands > croplands > forests and was found to be the highest in temperate environments. Similar patterns were found for biomass of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria and Actinobacteria. Soil fungal biomass was greater in forests than in croplands and grasslands and was favoured by colder environments. The fungi to bacteria ratio (F/B) decreased as follows: forests > croplands > grasslands, with soils in colder climates showing greater F/B ratios in croplands and forests. Soil texture, soil organic carbon, and nitrogen were shown to directly drive bacterial and fungal biomass. The biomass of the different microbial groups was not influenced by the crop type when only croplands were considered. Fungi were shown to be more susceptible to agricultural soil use than bacteria.\nTitle:\u00a0\u00a0 Land-use- and climate-mediated variations in soil bacterial and fungal biomass across Europe and their driving factors (based on LUCAS 2018)\nDescription: Data include measurements of soil FAME (fatty acid methyl esters) contents for bacteria and fungi.

The semiparametric model can capture non-linear interactions among input variables while accommodating censored and non-censored observations and can be calibrated to include information from other campaign databases. After fitting and validating a spatial model, we produced European-scale As concentration maps at a 250 m spatial resolution and evaluated the patterns against reference values (i.e., two action levels and a background concentration). We found a significant variability of As concentration across the continent, with lower concentrations in Northern countries and higher concentrations in Portugal, Spain, Austria, France and Belgium. By overcoming limitations in existing databases and methodologies, the present approach provides an alternative way to handle highly censored data.

{"text":"To reach the Paris climate targets, the mitigation capacity needs to be maximized across all components of the Earth system, especially land. Mitigation actions through land management, such as cover crops in agricultural soils, are often evaluated in terms of their carbon sequestration potential, while radiative forcing related to surface albedo changes is often ignored. The aim of this study was to assess the mitigation potential of cover crops, both as changes in biogenic greenhouse gas fluxes (CO2 and N2O) and albedo-driven radiative forcing at the top of the atmosphere (TOA). To achieve this, we have integrated a biogeochemistry model framework running on approximately 8,000 locations across the European Union with detailed soil data, supplemented with time series of albedo measurements derived from satellite remote sensing. We found that carbon sequestration remained the dominant mitigation effect, with 1th and 3rd interquartile of 5.2 \u2013 17.0 Mg CO2e ha-1 at 2050, and negligible changes in N2O emissions over that time-horizon. Cover crops were generally brighter than bare soils, hence, the reflected shortwave radiation at TOA ranged between 0.08 \u2013 0.22 Wm-2 on average, broadly equivalent to a removal of 0.8 \u2013 3.9 Mg CO2e ha-1. Through scenarios analysis, we further showed how the mitigation potential could be substantially increased by growing a high albedo chlorophyll-deficient cover crop. This radiative land management option has an additional benefit of providing its mitigation effect more rapidly than carbon sequestration, although additional studies might be warranted to evaluate local and non-local associated climatic effects, such as changes in patterns of surface temperature and precipitation.\nData:\nDue to the complexity of different datasets integrated, here we\u00a0 provided the\u00a0R script\u00a0and\u00a0R data format(.Rda), which allow to reproduce the text and supplementary figures of the paper.\nWe suggest downloading the folders in your local drive and executing the script, upon installation of missing libraries in case, to get familiar with the complex data structure.\nReference:\nLugato, E., Cescatti, A., Jones, A., Ceccherini, G., Duveiller, G., 2020.

{"text":"Metadata\nTitle: Copper distribution in European Union topsoilsDescription: Copper (Cu) distribution in soil is influenced by climatic, geological and pedological factors. Apart from geological sources and industrial pollution, other anthropogenic sources, related to the agricultural activity, may increase copper levels in soils, especially in permanent crops such as olive groves and vineyards. This study uses 21,682 soil samples from the LUCAS topsoil survey to investigate copper distribution in the soils of 25 European Union (EU) Member States.Generalized Linear Models (GLM) were used to investigate the factors driving copper distribution in EU soils. Regression analysis shows the importance of topsoil properties, land cover and climate in estimating Cu concentration. Meanwhile, a copper regression model confirms our hypothesis that different agricultural management practices have a relevant influence on Cu concentration. Besides the traditional use of copper as a fungicide for treatments in several permanent crops, the combined effect of soil properties such as high pH, soil organic carbon and clay, with humid and wet climatic conditions favours copper accumulation in soils of vineyards and tree crops.Spatial Coverage: European Union 25 Member States (no data for Croatia, Cyprus and Malta)Resolution: 500mTime Reference:\u00a0 2009Format: Raster (Grid)Projection: ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal AreaInput data: 21,682 measured points of LUCAS survey and other auxiliary variables: Geology, Land use & vegetation, Climate, Topography, Soil Properties.More Information: The copper in soilsRelease Date: 8/5/2018\nCompared to the overall average Cu concentration of 16.85 mg kg-1, vineyards have the highest mean soil Cu concentration (49.26 mg kg-1) of all land use categories, followed by olive groves and orchards.The derived maps are novel as they include information about the importance of topsoil properties in the copper mapping process, thus improving its accuracy. The regression and the interpolation model highlight the influence of land management practices in copper concentration and the strong correlation between topsoil copper and vineyards. ore details can be found in the recent published paper.\nIn addition, special attention was given to the vineyards copper accumulation and net export. We provide the data also for copper in vineyards as published in the recent paper. Copper-based fungicides are used in European(EU) vineyards to prevent fungal diseases. Soil physicochemical properties locally govern the variation of the total copper content in vineyards. Using a machine learning model, a study found that main variables to predict the Cu distribution in EU vineyards are precipitation, aridity and soil organic carbon. The estimated average net accumulation and net export of Cu in topsoil in European vineyards are 24.8 and 0.29 kg Cu ha\u22121. This corresponds to 112,400 tons of Cu accumulated over time, and a yearly Cu export from vineyards of 1466 tons across Europe.","id":"https://esdac.jrc.ec.europa.eu//content/copper-distribution-topsoils"}
{"text":"Title: Global Erosion potential method (EPM)\nDescription: Most of the modelling applications are using Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE)-type models. In the activities of EU Soil Observatory working group on erosion, it is undelined that the soil erosion modelling community should also make a step towards intercomparison of global multi-models, gaining new insights from the advantages and disadvantages found in the compared models. Here, we evaluate the applicability of the Erosion Potential Model (EPM) and its modified version (mEPM) for the estimation of the gross and net erosion rates at a global scale. The sensitivity analysis shows that the model results have the highest variability due to the soil protection (land cover) coefficient followed by the soil erodibility parameter. The models\u2019 evaluations indicate that that the EPM cannot be applied to cold regions while the mEPM overcomes this issue. The erosion rates based on the EPM were 1.5\u20132.5 times larger than the ones obtained from the mEPM. Increasing the number of catchment properties as inputs to the model may help in improving the performance of the tested EPM and mEPM. Moreover, a comparison of net soil losses by mEPM with long-term suspended sediment yield data for 116 catchments located around the globe indicates a median bias of less than 10%, although the bias for around 1/3 of catchments was above 100%. Furthermore, a direct comparison with other soil erosion models such as USLE-type models is not possible since the EPM and mEPM do take into consideration other processes such as soil slumps and gully erosion and not just sheet and rill erosion. Therefore, as expected, the gross erosion rates by the EPM and mEPM are higher compared to the USLE-type models. Hence, the mEPM, despite its limitations, could be regarded as an interesting approach for the describing erosion processes around the globe and should be further tested using small- and medium-sized catchments from various climate zones.Spatial coverage: GlobalPixel size: 0.0083 degrees (800m)Measurement Unit: Integer pixel values corresponding to soil losses as t ha-1 yr-1.Projection: 4326 - WGS 84Temporal coverage:\u00a0 2010\nType of Dataset: GeoTiff.\nGet the README file to better understand the data.\nReference: Bezak, N., Borrelli, P., Matja\u017e M., Au\ufb02i\u010d M., Panagos, P., 2024.

{"text":"Title: Cadmium distribution in EU topsoils\nDescription: Cadmiun (Cd) is a naturally occurring element that can accumulate in the soil through the application of fertilisers containing cadmium and as a waste of industrial processes. Cadmium inputs in the soil have increased significantly (+50 %) during the 20th century as a result of the application of fertilisers and sewage sludge, and also due to local contamination (e.g. waste dumping, mining) and industrial emissions (e.g. zinc smelters). Using the 21,682 soil samples from the LUCAS soil survey, we aim to estimate the spatial distribution of the concentration of Cd in the European Union (EU) and UK topsoil. Applying an ensemble of machine learning models supported by a variety of environmental descriptors, we created maps of Cd distribution at a resolution of 100 m. The ensemble approach included five models and increased the prediction accuracy to R2 of 0.45 (an increase of 0.1 compared to best single model performance). The approach used resulted in a high predictive power for the general Cd distribution, while also identifying hotspots of Cd contamination. Natural factors influencing Cd levels include soil properties (pH, clay), topography, soil erosion, and leaching. As anthropogenic factors, we identified phosphorus inputs to agricultural lands as the most important for Cd levels. The application of the EU Fertiliser Directive should further limit Cd inputs and potentially the Cd content in soils.Spatial coverage: EU+ UKPixel size: 100mMeasurement Unit: mg kg-1Projection: ETRS89Temporal coverage:\u00a0 2009 (as LUCAS Samples are dates in 2009)\nType of Dataset: GeoTiff\nMore information about Cadmium in topsoils\u00a0\nReference: Ballabio, C., Jones, A. and Panagos, P., 2024.

{"text":"C budget in the EU agricultural soils including lateral C fluxes\nSoil play a significant environmental role in balancing the climate as it currently acts as a carbon sink, sequestering CO2 from the atmosphere into soil organic carbon. Using a new biogeochemistry-erosion model to quantify the impact of future climate on the carbon cycle, the authors track the possible transformations of the organic carbon across the landscape.

In September 2019, we conluded the development of the LUCAS Chemical parameters [pH, pH CaCl, Cation Exchange Capacity (CEC), Calcium carbonates (CaCO3), C:N ratio, Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P) and Potassium (K)]\u00a0 and we made them available for download together with the scientific publications.\nWith 22,000 sampled locations the LUCAS soil database is unique in Europe for the number of available observations, its spatial coverage and its temporal resolution. While LUCAS point data are available upon request from the European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC), the interpolated maps of chemical properties offer a better overview of the distribution of soil chemical properties in the EU to the scientific community and to policy makers. The derived maps will establish baselines that will help monitor soil quality and provide guidance to agro-environmental research and policy developments in the European Union. The chemical properties datasets, together with the physical properties, contribute to one of the main objectives of the GlobalSoilMap project.\nThe modelling is based on Gaussian Process Regression technique that allows the estimation of prediction uncertainty. The best performing prediction was obtained for the C:N ratio (R2=0.91), followed by phosphorus and potassium (R2=0.75). The performance prediction of the rest of chemical properties in terms of R2 is higher than 0.60 with the exception of CEC (R2= 0.35).\nTopsoil pH is influenced by soil parent material, erosional effects, climate and vegetation. The calcium carbonate content is highly correlated with pH, having similar influencing factors. Soil nitrogen distribution is dependent on soil organic carbon, vegetation and climate and soil texture. The land use appears to be the main driver for phosphorus content in soils, as agricultural areas have higher concentrations due to fertilizer application. CEC is influenced by the clay distribution in soils, topography and parent material.\n\u00a0\nReferences\nBallabio, C., Lugato, E., Fern\u00e1ndez-Ugalde, O., Orgiazzi, A., Jones, A., Borrelli, P., Montanarella, L. and Panagos, P., 2019.

Such a fraction is assumed to vary between 0% (i.e., no cover crops in the pixel) to 100% (i.e., pixel completely covered by cover crops). The values in the raster files are multiplied by 100 to facilitate compression. For instance, a raster value of 1234 corresponds to a 12.34% cover crops fraction.

{"text":"This dataset encompasses global soil erodibility (K) factor maps, with the K factor being estimated through the Wischmeier and Smith (1978) method. The equation incorporates permeability information crudely and indirectly, mainly relying on soil texture details, potentially overlooking factors like vegetation, biopores, and clay minerals. To address this limitation, we integrated measured Ksat values, representing soil hydraulic properties, into the Wischmeier and Smith (1978) soil texture-based K factor equation (referred to as KWischmeier factor) to formulate the Ksat-based soil erodibility (Kksat factor) map. Our dataset consists of approximately 6000 measured Ksat samples worldwide, linked with environmental covariates using the quantile random forest algorithm to generate 1 km spatial resolution maps for both Ksat and KWischmeier factors. Additionally, we calculated uncertainty for the Kksat and KWischmeier factor maps, represented by 90% prediction intervals (PI) through quantile calculations at 0.05 and 0.95. This uncertainty assessment was performed using the quantreg option in the R package \u2018ranger\u2019 (Wright and Ziegler 2015), termed as Uncertainty Kksat and Uncertainty KWischmeier. Comparisons were made between the Kksat and KWischmeier factor maps and Borrelli et al. (2017) KGloSEM factor map. The results indicated a reduction in Kksat factor values in tropical regions, highlighting differences in soil properties such as clay and iron. In contrast, other climate regions exhibited relatively minor changes compared to both the KWischmeier factor and Borrelli et al. 2017 KGloSEM factor map.\nImportant notice: For European use, we recommend the European K-factor dataset\nReference: Gupta, S., Borrelli, P., Panagos, P., Alewell, C., 2024.

{"text":"Using CE-DYNAM model, we were able to reconstruct the historical spatiotemporal variability of soil loss by water erosion in Europe. The annual variations do not follow a linear pattern through time, thus affecting erosion calculations unequally. The calculations also indicate an overall increase in erosion rates from 1860 to 1960 due mainly to land cover changes and a peak in rainfall erosivity, followed by an overall decrease from 1960 to 2018. The hillslope erosion rates were externally validated by comparing our estimates with some field observations and modeled values in the literature.\nTitle: Historical reconstruction of soil erosion in EuropeDescription: This dataset includes the past reconstruction of soil erosion rates in Europe (incuding UK, Switzerland and Western balkans).

Compared to the existing datasets, this study provides a new higher resolution geospatial assessment of the agricultural land suitability for several crops and land uses in the temperate continental climate across Europe. To model the land suitability we used geospatial data depicting seventeen eco-pedological indicators (e.g. soil texture, pH, porosity, temperature, precipitation, slope). To evaluate how the land is utilized, the suitability maps have been spatially cross-tabulated with a crop map. Over the entire study area, wheat and barley showed significant suitable land in the southern part, potatoes, and sugar beet exhibited the highest extent of suitable land in the northern parts, while corn and sunflower exhibited a much lower extent of suitable land. Water table depth, precipitation, temperature, terrain slope, soil porosity, SOC, and topsoil texture emerged as the limiting factors for agricultural suitability in the study area. Our results show that the suitable arable land does not have space left for the expansion of crops, however, we have identified regions with extensive cultivation of wheat and corn on unsuitable land with the potential for cultivation of more suitable crops such as barley, sunflower, sugar beet, and potato. It seems that one action that can enhance agricultural practices in the study area is to better allocate each cultivated crop across more suitable lands.\nSuitability maps were created for 14 crops (wheat, barley, corn, sunflower, potato, sugar beet, soy, pea-bean, linseed for oil, linseed for fiber (tow), hemp, alfalfa-lucerne, clover, vegetables), 7 fruit trees (apple, pear, plum, cherry, apricot, peach, grapes) and 3 land-use types (arable, pasture, and hayfield).\nLimitations imposed by soil and ecological (environmental) parameters (below).\nEnvironmental indicators (climate, terrain, water/moisture): Average annual temperature, Total annual precipitation, Slope gradient, Water table depth, Floods frequency, Landslides, Surface moisture excess\nSoil indicators: Topsoil texture class, pH, Soil organic carbon (SOC) stock, Edaphic volume, Soil porosity, Gleyzation, Stagnogleyzation, Carbonates content, Salinization/alkalinization, Soil pollution\nScale: 250m pixel sizeTime Reference: 2020Format: Tiff\nReference: Dornik, A., Che\u0163an, M.A., Cri\u015fan, T.E., Heciko, R., Gora, A., Dr\u0103gu\u0163, L. and Panagos, P., 2024.

{"text":"Metadata\nTitle: Land degradation in global arable lands.Description: Land degradation is a global environmental issue that affects the world's arable lands on a large scale, thus threatening global food production systems. This study analyzes the land degradation footprint on global arable lands, using complex geospatial data on certain major degradation processes, i.e. aridity, soil erosion, vegetation decline, soil salinization and soil organic carbon decline. By applying geostatistical techniques that are representative for identifying the incidence of the five land degradation processes in global arable lands, results showed that aridity is by far the largest singular pressure for these agricultural systems, affecting ~40% of the arable lands' area, which cover approximately 14 million km2 globally. Therefore, the world's arable lands are particularly vulnerable to uni-degradation (the incidence of a single degradation process), through large-scale aridity conditions. Also, it was found that soil erosion is another major degradation process, the unilateral impact of which affects ~20% of global arable systems.Resolution: 1kmTime Reference:\u00a0 2012Format: GeoTIFFProjection: Equal-area MollweideInput data: Aridity, soil erosion, vegetation decline, soil salinization and soil organic carbon decline.More Information:Release Date: 28/1/2021\nRelevance: While agricultural systems are a major pillar in global food security, their productivity is currently threatened by many environmental issues triggered by anthropogenic climate change and human activities, such as land degradation. However, the planetary spatial footprint of land degradation processes on arable lands, which can be considered a major component of global agricultural systems, is still insufficiently well understood. The results of this study showed, among others, that aridity and soil erosion simultaneously affect an additional ~7% of global arable lands, which makes this synergy the most common form of multi-degradation (multiple pressure of land degradative conditions) across the world's arable areas. This study's findings can be useful for prioritizing agricultural management actions that can mitigate the negative effects of the two degradation processes or of others that currently affect many arable systems across the planet. Details can be found in the recent published paper. More info about land degradation.\nNote: Many thanks to our colleagues in University of Bucharest for this collaboration.

Among the six input layers, the combined slope length and slope angle (LS-factor) has the greatest influence on soil loss at the European scale. The S-factor measures the effect of slope steepness, and the L-factor defines the impact of slope length. The combined LS-factor describes the effect of topography on soil erosion. The European Soil Data Centre (ESDAC) developed a new pan-European high-resolution soil erosion assessment to achieve a better understanding of the spatial and temporal patterns of soil erosion in Europe. The LS-calculation was performed using the original equation proposed by Desmet and Govers (1996) and implemented using the System for Automated Geoscientific Analyses (SAGA), which incorporates a multiple flow algorithm and contributes to a precise estimation of flow accumulation. The LS-factor dataset was calculated using a high-resolution (25 m) Digital Elevation Model (DEM) for the whole European Union, resulting in an improved delineation of areas at risk of soil erosion as compared to lower-resolution datasets. This combined approach of using GIS software tools with high-resolution DEMs has been successfully applied in regional assessments in the past, and is now being applied for first time at the European scale.\nData\nThe LS-factor dataset is in Raster format.

{"text":"In the past 20 years, the use of pesticides in agricultural lands have been target of several European Union (EU) regulations. More recently, and in line with several EU sustainability goals, the use of pesticides has been targeted by relevant policy ambitions aiming to reduce their use and risk following health and environmental concerns. Nonetheless, the current knowledge on soil contamination by pesticides residues is limited, due to a lack of systematic soil monitoring studies addressing soil pollution, especially at EU scale.\nTo fulfil this knowledge gap, the EU Soil Observatory led a study targeting residues of active ingredients of pesticides used as crop protection products in soil samples collected from the 2018 LUCAS survey. This is the largest study providing a comprehensive characterization on the extent of residues of active ingredients from pesticides in the soils of the EU. This work establishes an initial EU baseline, and project a future assessment of the effectiveness of EU policies and regulations targeting pesticides use and soil pollution. Moreover, this study provides the first steps on the development of risk indicators for soil, allowing to present the first temporal assessment of pesticides in EU soils following a pilot study with samples from 2015 LUCAS survey.\nThis study highlights that pesticide residues in soils are widespread in the European agricultural land (74.5% sites), whereas most of the sites (57.1%) present mixtures of substances (two or more). Additionally, an indicator of the ecotoxicological impact for soil organisms was developed. This indicator compared the concentration of these substances with the no effect concentration (NOEC) for soil organisms, identifying areas at higher risk (1.7% sites). But also, allowed to estimate an increase in ecotoxicological risk when compared with a previous assessment (2015-2018). Finally, among the substances found was also possible to identify non-approved substances in soils (12%), concerning long-banned substances, and several active ingredients that, subsequent to the sampling campaign, the Commission decided not to renew their approval as active substances under Regulation (EC) No 1107/2009.\nThe current study brought by the EU Soil Observatory and LUCAS 2018 soil module provides a significant contribution to the status of current knowledge on soil pollution in the EU. The insights provided in this report may help identifying target policies in creating a toxic-free environment.\nThe study is fully described in https://data.europa.eu/doi/10.2760/86566 and an overview is given below.\n\u00a0\nSpatial Coverage: EU + UK\nScale: NUTS 2 (Regional scale)Time Reference: 2018Format: .xlsx\nData available for 118 substances and 3473 sites.\nData Structure:\nNUTS2_conc_EU - Average pesticide residue concentration (mg Kg-1) by NUTS2\nNUTS2_count_EU - Number of samples considered for average calculation.\nLabel on substances analyzed - Chemical Name, CAS Number, LOQ (mg Kg-1).\nRelease Date: 25/02/2024\nMore information about the Pesticides residues in EU agricultural soils based on LUCAS\n\nFigure \u2013 Pesticide incidence (left panel) and content (right panel) distribution (%) for all soil samples (EU) and by Country.

{"text":"Title: Modelled phosphorus cycle in European agricultural soils.\nDescription: Phosphorus (P) is an essential nutrient for all crops, yet its excess negatively affects public health, the environment, and the economy. At the same time, rock P is a critical raw material due to its importance for food production, the finite geological deposits, and its unequal regional distribution. Process-based biogeochemical models are valuable instruments to monitor the P cycle and predict the effect of agricultural management policies. Therefore, we upscale the calibrated DayCent model at the European level using data-derived soil properties, advanced input data sets, and representative management practices. Our results depicted a P budget, total soil P, and available P content consistent with literature and national statistics. Agricultural management scenarios revealed a range of potential changes in the P budget by 2030 and 2050, influenced by the interlink of P with biogeochemical carbon and nitrogen cycles. Thus, the approach used was capable of i) identifying areas with P surplus or deficit at high spatial resolution of 1 km2, ii) pinpointing areas where a change in agricultural management would be most urgent to reach policy goals in terms of environmental pollution, food security and resource efficiency of a critical raw material, and iii) predicting the response of the P cycle to modifications in agricultural management.

{"text":"Metadata\nTitle: Natural susceptibility to compaction\nBackground Introduction: This map shows the natural susceptibility of agricultural soils to compaction if they were to be exposed to compaction. The evaluation of the soil\u2019s natural susceptibility is based on the creation of logical connections between relevant parameters (pedotransfer rules). The input parameters for these pedotransfer rules are taken from the attributes of the European soil database, e.g. soil properties: type, texture and water regime, depth to textural change and the limitation of the soil for agricultural use. Besides the main parameters auxiliary parameters have been used as impermeable layer, depth of an obstacle to roots, water management system, dominant and secondary land use. It was assumed that every soil, as a porous medium, could be compacted.\nSpatial coverage:27 Member States of the European Union where data available.\nPixel size: 1km\nProjection: ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area\nInput data source: Soil data - European Soil Database v2, Land Use - CORINE Land Cover 2000\nExplanation about the data:\nThe map of natural soil susceptibility to compaction was created from the evaluation of selected parameters from the ESDB.

{"text":"Annually, millions of hectares of land are affected by wildfires worldwide, disrupting ecosystems functioning by affecting on-site vegetation, soil, and above- and belowground biodiversity, but also triggering erosive off-site impacts such as water-bodies contamination or mudflows. Here, we present a soil erosion assessment following the 2017\u2019s wildfires at the European scale, including an analysis of vegetation recovery and soil erosion mitigation potential. Results indicate a sharp increase in soil losses with 19.4 million Mg additional erosion in the first post-fire year when compared to unburned conditions. Over five years, 44 million Mg additional soil losses were estimated, and 46% of the burned area presented no signs of full recovery. Post-fire mitigation could attenuate these impacts by 63-77%, reducing soil erosion to background levels by the 4th post-fire year.

{"text":"Because of the increasing pressures exerted on soil, below-ground life is under threat. Knowledge-based rankings of potential threats to different components of soil biodiversity were developed in order to assess the spatial distribution of threats on a European scale. A list of 13 potential threats to soil biodiversity was proposed to experts with different backgrounds in order to assess the potential for three major components of soil biodiversity: soil microorganisms, fauna, and biological functions. This approach allowed us to obtain knowledge-based rankings of threats. These classifications formed the basis for the development of indices through an additive aggregation model that, along with ad-hoc proxies for each pressure, allowed us to preliminarily assess the spatial patterns of potential threats. Intensive exploitation was identified as the highest pressure. In contrast, the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture was considered as the threat with least potential. The potential impact of climate change showed the highest uncertainty. Fourteen out of the 27 considered countries have more than 40% of their soils with moderate-high to high potential risk for all three components of soil biodiversity. Arable soils are the most exposed to pressures. Soils within the boreal biogeographic region showed the lowest risk potential. The majority of soils at risk are outside the boundaries of protected areas. First maps of risks to three components of soil biodiversity based on the current scientific knowledge were developed. Despite the intrinsic limits of knowledge-based assessments, a remarkable potential risk to soil biodiversity was observed. Guidelines to preliminarily identify and circumscribe soils potentially at risk are provided. This approach may be used in future research to assess threat at both local and global scale and identify areas of possible risk and, subsequently, design appropriate strategies for monitoring and protection of soil biota.\nMetadata:\nTitle: Potential threats to soil biodiversity in Europe.Description: Three major components of soil biodiversity are assesed: a) soil microorganisms, b) fauna, and c) biological functions.

The data are also availbable from the publication website.\nThe objectives of this study were (i) to quantify and compare the priming effect (PE) in 126 soils from cropland and seminatural (i.e., forests and grasslands) ecosystems, as well as in cropland soils cultivated with three important crop types in Europe: cereals, industrial crops and fruit and vineyard orchards; and (ii) model the main factors controlling the PE under contrasting land uses. PEs were measured after soil 13C-glucose addition and incubation at 20 \u00b0C for 35 days. These microcosms were also used to assess basal respiration for the same period. Soil and climate data were obtained from the same LUCAS 2018 survey and online databases. Data on microbial biomass C and enzyme activities were obtained from previous published studies. Bacterial and fungal biomass was quantified through fatty acid methyl esters (FAME) analysis. Random Forest analysis and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to explore the main drivers of the PE.\nOn average, PEs were negative in seminatural and cropland soils, meaning that microbial communities preferentially switched from soil organic C (SOC) decomposition to glucose mineralization. PEs were significantly less negative in croplands compared with seminatural ecosystems and not influenced by the crop type. The input of easily available C sources (glucose) thus decreased SOC mineralization, and this decrease was stronger in seminatural ecosystems compared to croplands. Fresh organic C input contributes to the positive C balance not only by new SOC formation, but also by decreasing mineralization of existing SOC. Modelling showed that PEs were driven by soil basal respiration (reflecting microbial activity), microbial biomass C, and soil organic C, which were all higher in seminatural ecosystems compared with croplands.\n\u00a0\nMetadata\nTitle:\u00a0 Glucose-induced priming effects in soils.Description: Data include measurements of PE, basal respiration and soil FAME contents for bacteria and fungi. .Spatial coverage: European Union; Temporal coverage: 2018Measurement Unit: Priming effect and basal respiration: \u03bcC g\u22121 soil.

The new proposed dataset has also been verified against local/regional/national studies with very good results. Soil erosion modellers (and not only) may use it for their applications at any scale. The aim of this study is the generation of a harmonised high-resolution soil erodibility map (with a grid cell size of 500 m) for the 25 EU Member States and then for the 28 Member States. Soil erodibility was calculated for the LUCAS survey points using the nomograph of Wischmeier and Smith (1978). A Cubist regression model was applied to correlate spatial data such as latitude, longitude, remotely sensed and terrain features in order to develop a high-resolution soil erodibility map. The mean K-factor for Europe was estimated at 0.032 t ha h ha-1 MJ-1 mm-1 with a standard deviation of 0.009 t ha h ha-1 MJ-1 mm-1. The yielded soil erodibility dataset compared well with the published local and regional soil erodibility data. However, the incorporation of the protective effect of surface stone cover, which is usually not considered for the soil erodibility calculations, resulted in an average 15% decrease of the K-factor. The exclusion of this effect in K-factor calculations is likely to result in an overestimation of soil erosion, particularly for the Mediterranean countries, where highest percentages of surface stone cover were observed.\u00a0\nThe high-resolution soil erodibility map (500m) version 2014 incorporates certain improvements over the coarse-resolution map (10km) version 2011:\u00a0\n\nHigh resolution dataset (500m) and application of Cubist regression-interpolation (better spatial accuracy)\nSoil structure was for the first time included in the K-factor estimation\u00a0\nCoarse fragments were taken into account for the better estimation of soil permeability\nSurface stone content, which acts as protection against soil erosion was for the first time included in the K-factor estimation.

{"text":"Description\nTo quantify direct and indirect relationships between soil microbial community properties (potential basal respiration, microbial biomass) and abiotic factors (soil, climate) in three major land-cover types, we collected 881 soil samples from across Europe in the framework of the Land Use/Land Cover Area Frame Survey (LUCAS). We measured potential soil basal respiration at 20\u00a0\u00baC and microbial biomass (substrate-induced respiration) using an O2-microcompensation apparatus. Soil and climate data were obtained from the same LUCAS survey and online databases. Structural equation models (SEMs) were used to quantify relationships between variables, and equations extracted from SEMs were used to create predictive maps. Fatty acid methyl esters were measured in a subset of samples to distinguish fungal from bacterial biomass.\nSoil microbial properties in croplands were more heavily affected by climate variables than those in forests. Potential soil basal respiration and microbial biomass were correlated in forests but decoupled in grasslands and croplands, where microbial biomass depended on soil carbon. Forests had a higher ratio of fungi to bacteria than grasslands or croplands.\nSoil microbial communities in grasslands and croplands are likely carbon-limited in comparison with those in forests, and forests have a higher dominance of fungi indicating differences in microbial community composition. Notably, the often already-degraded soils of croplands could be more vulnerable to climate change than more natural soils. The provided maps show potentially vulnerable areas that should be explicitly accounted for in future management plans to protect soil carbon and slow the increasing vulnerability of European soils to climate change.\nMetadata\nTitle: Large-scale drivers of relationships between soil microbial properties and organic carbon across Europe.Description: Maps of potential soil microbial basal respiration (bas), microbial biomass (Cmic), and respiratory quotient (qO2) predicted across Europe for the year 2018.

Several soil properties were predicted using hybrid approaches like regression kriging. For those datasets, we predicted topsoil texture and related derived physical properties.

The high temporal resolution of MODIS allowed detecting changes in the vegetative response due to soil properties, which can then be used to map soil features distribution.We will also discuss the prediction of intrinsically collinear variables like soil texture which required the use of models capable of dealing with multivariate constrained dependent variables like Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS).

{"text":"Open AccessBiochar pore space consists of porosity of multiple length scales. In direct water holding applications like water storage for plant water uptake, the main interest is in micrometre-range porosity since these pores are able to store water that is easily available for plants. Gas adsorption measurements which are commonly used to characterize the physical pore structure of biochars are not able to quantify this pore-size range. While pyrogenetic porosity (i.e. pores formed during pyrolysis process) tends to increase with elevated process temperature, it is uncertain whether this change affects the pore space capable to store plant available water. In this study, we characterized biochar porosity with x-ray tomography which provides quantitative information on the micrometer-range porosity. We imaged willow dried at 60 $^ circ$C and biochar samples pyrolysed in three different temperatures (peak temperatures 308, 384, 489 $^ circ$C, heating rate 2 $^ circ$C min$^{-1}$). Samples were carefully prepared and traced through the experiments, which allowed investigation of porosity development in micrometre size range. Pore space was quantified with image analysis of x-ray tomography images and, in addition, nanoscale porosity was examined with helium ion microscopy. The image analysis results show that initial pore structure of the raw material determines the properties of micrometre-range porosity in the studied temperature range. Thus, considering the pore-size regime relevant to the storage of plant available water, pyrolysis temperature in the studied range does not provide means to optimize the biochar structure. However, these findings do not rule out that process temperature may affect the water retention properties of biochars by modifying the chemical properties of the pore surfaces.

Fifty-four (54) auxiliary variables in the form of raster maps at 5km resolution were used to explain the differences in the distribution of soil pHCaCl2 and the kriged map of the residuals from the regression model was added. The goodness of fit of the regression model was satisfactory (R2adj = 0.43) and its residuals follow a Gaussian distribution. The lowest values correspond to the soils developed on acid rock (granites, quartzite\u2019s, sandstones, etc), while the higher values are related to the presence of calcareous sediments and basic rocks. The validation of the model shows that the model is quite accurate (R2adj = 0.56).

Contour farming contributes very little to the P-factor given its limited application; it is only used as a support practice in eight countries and only on very steep slopes. Support practices have the highest impact in Malta, Portugal, Spain, Italy, Greece, Belgium, Netherlands and United Kingdom where they reduce soil erosion risk by at least 5%.

The aim of this study was to create a map of topsoil OC content at the European scale by applying digital soil mapping techniques to the first European harmonized geo-referenced topsoil (0\u201320cm) database, which arises from the Land use/Cover Area frame statistical Survey (LUCAS). A map of the associated uncertainty was also produced to support careful use of the predicted OC contents. A generalized additive model (GAM) was fitted on 85% of the dataset (R2 = 0.29), using OC content as dependent variable; a backward stepwise approach selected slope, land cover, temperature, net primary productivity, latitude and longitude as suitable covariates. The validation of the model (performed on 15% of the data-set) gave an overall R2 of 0.27 and an R2 of 0.21 for mineral soils and 0.06 for organic soils. Organic C content in most organic soils was under-predicted, probably because of the imposed unimodal distribution of our model, whose mean is tilted towards the prevalent mineral soils. This was also confirmed by the poor prediction in Scandinavia (where organic soils are more frequent), which gave an R2 of 0.09, whilst the prediction performance (R2) in non-Scandinavian countries was 0.28. The map of predicted OC content had the smallest values in Mediterranean countries and in croplands across Europe, whereas largest OC contents were predicted in wetlands, woodlands and mountainous areas.

{"text":"Projections of soil loss by water erosion in Europe by 2050\nChanges in future soil erosion rates are driven by climatic conditions, land use patterns, socio-economic development, farmers\u2019 choices, and importantly modified by agro-environmental policies. This study simulates the impact of expected climatic and land use change projections on future rates of soil erosion by water (sheet and rill processes) in 2050 within the agricultural areas of the European Union and the UK, compared to a current representative baseline (2016). We used the Revised Universal Soil Loss Equation (RUSLE) adjusted at continental scale with projections of future rainfall erosivity and land use change. Future rainfall erosivity is predicted using an average composite of 19 Global Climate Models (GCMs) from the Coupled Model Inter-comparison Projects (CMIP5) WorldClim dataset across three Representative Concentration Pathways (RCP2.6, RCP4.5 and RCP8.5). Concerning future land use change and crop dynamics, we used the projections provided by the Common Agricultural Policy Regional Impact Analysis (CAPRI) model.\nDepending on the RCP scenario, we estimate a +13%-22.5% increase in the mean soil erosion rate in the EU and UK, rising from an estimated 3.07 t ha-1 yr-1 (2016) to between 3.46 t ha-1 yr-1 (RCP2.6 scenario) and 3.76 t ha-1 yr-1 (RCP8.5 scenario). Here, we disentangle the impact of land use change and climate change in relation to future soil losses. Projected land use change in the EU and UK indicates an overall increase of pasture coverage in place of croplands. This land use change is estimated to reduce soil erosion rates (-3%). In contrast, \u00a0the increases in future rainfall erosivity (+15.7%-25.5%) will force important increases of soil erosion requiring further targeted intervention measures.\n.\nMain highlights\n\nModelled area: 1.8 million Km2\u00a0which is about ~41.5% of European Union (EU27) and UK (focus in agricultural soils).\nResolution: 100m x 100m\nGlobal Coverage: European Union (EU27) and UK\nClimate inpiuts: Three alternative (2.6, 4.5 & 8.5) Shared Socioeconomic Pathway and Representative Concentration Pathway (SSP-RCP) scenarios. 19 General Climate Circulation Models (GCMs) used to assess future rainfall erosivity scenarios\nLand cover inputs: Common Agricultural Policy Regional Impact analysis (CAPRI) model projects on crop dynamics and land use changes.\nTotal soil loss:The baseline model (2016) estimates the soil loss in agricultural soils to about 553 Mt yr-1 while the projections estimate an increase to 595-645 Mt yr-1 by 2050.\u00a0\nMean soil loss: Soil loss by water erosion is projected to increase by 13\u201322.5 % in EU and UK by 2050.

{"text":"Title: Zinc concentrations in EU topsoils.Description: Zinc (Zn) is essential to sustain crop production and human health, while it can be toxic when present in excess. In this manuscript, we applied a machine learning model on 21,682 soil samples from the Land Use and Coverage Area frame Survey (LUCAS) topsoil database of 2009/2012 to assess the spatial distribution in Europe of topsoil Zn concentrations measured by aqua regia extraction, and to identify the influence of natural drivers and anthropogenic sources on topsoil Zn concentrations. As a result, a map was produced showing topsoil Zn concentrations in Europe at a resolution of 250 m. The mean predicted Zn concentration in Europe was 41 mg kg\u22121, with a root mean squared error of around 40 mg kg\u22121 calculated for independent soil samples. We identified clay content as the most important factor explaining the overall distribution of soil Zn in Europe, with lower Zn concentrations in coarser soils. Next to texture, low Zn concentrations were found in soils with low pH (e.g. Podzols), as well as in soils with pH above 8 (i.e., Calcisols). The presence of deposits and mining activities mainly explained the occurrence of relatively high Zn concentrations above 167 mg kg\u22121 (the one percentile highest concentrations) within 10 km from these sites. In addition, the relatively higher Zn levels found in grasslands in regions with high livestock density may point to manure as a significant source of Zn in these soils. The map developed in this study can be used as a reference to assess the eco-toxicological risks associated with soil Zn concentrations in Europe and areas with Zn deficiency. In addition, it can provide a baseline for future policies in the context of pollution, soil health, human health, and crop nutrition.Resolution: 250mTime Reference:\u00a0 2009Format: GeoTIFFProjection: ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal AreaInput data: 21,682 measured points of LUCAS survey and other auxiliary variables: Geology, Land use & vegetation, Climate, Topography, Soil Properties.More Information: Zinc in topsoilsRelease Date: 16/6/2023\nReference: Van Eynde, E., Fendrich, A.

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience Fractionated pyrolysis coupled to gas chromatography and mass spectrometry (Py-GC/MS) appears as an interesting analytical tool for elucidating lignocellulosic biomass structure, as it allows the progressive release of chemical fragments representative of biomass macromolecular composition. In this paper the effect of fractionated pyrolysis time (from 5\u2009s to 300\u2009s) on the degradation of lignin and carbohydrates from beech wood was studied at temperatures between 250\u2009\u00b0C and 500\u2009\u00b0C. Fractionated Py-GC/MS showed that the release temperature of the volatile degradation products varied between the volatile species detected. In addition, the step duration time changed the thermal degradation behavior of lignocellulosic components. Shortening the constant step duration time from 300\u2009s to 5\u2009s shifted the maximum weight loss to the higher temperatures. The result was opposite at long step duration times. Time optimization at each pyrolysis temperature (250\u2009\u00b0C, 40\u2009s; 300\u2009\u00b0C, 30\u2009s; 350\u2009\u00b0C, 25\u2009s; 370\u2009\u00b0C, 20\u2009s; 400\u2009\u00b0C, 15\u2009s; 450\u2009\u00b0C, 10\u2009s; 500\u2009\u00b0C, 5\u2009s) enhanced the yield of both lignin and carbohydrate volatile pyrolysis degradation products. In addition, two multiple temperature maxima were shown for some lignin and carbohydrate derivatives. This behavior may be due to the two different pathways of formation and macromolecular origins of compounds in beech wood. At optimized conditions lignin derivatives having a 3-carbon side chain substituent had a maximum at lower temperature than that of lignin derivatives with a 1-carbon side chain substituent. That phenomenon follows the order of primary and secondary pyrolysis reactions. Similar behaviors were observed among the degradation products of hemicelluloses and cellulose. Degradation products of hemicelluloses were mainly released at lower temperatures than those of cellulose derivatives, which illustrates the lower thermal stability of hemicelluloses compared to cellulose.","id":"10.1016/j.jaap.2018.11.026"}

The Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (PLSDA) statistical method was also used to classify the figurines of uncertain geographical origin. The resulting groups were related to typological and stylistic groups of figurines and the distribution in different sites in the region.

{"text":"Wastewater treatment plant sludge contains large quantities of microplastics (MPs), which is a problematic substance that impedes sustainability efforts, such as in land management. MPs are resilient to degradation, but extreme conditions, such as high temperature and pressure, can lead to residues that can be used as fertilizers on farmlands. Hydrothermal liquefaction (HTL) creates such conditions, converting sludge into valuable bio-crude. To this end, the current study examined the resilience of MPs in sewage sludge that were treated by continuous HTL operated at supercritical water conditions (400 \u25e6C, 30 MPa). MPs were extracted before and after the HTL process and quantified by Fourier Transformation Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR). Particles of 10\u2013500 \u03bcm were quantified using Focal Plane Array (FPA) based micro-FTIR (FPA-\u03bc-FTIR) imaging combined with an automated analysis of the generated spectral image, while Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR)-FTIR was used for MPs &gt;500 \u03bcm. The continuous HTL led to an MP reduction of approximately 76% in terms of MP number and 97% in terms of MP mass. The difference in reduction of the number of MPs versus their accumulated mass was the result of MPs being smaller after the HTL process. A total of 18 polymer types were detected in the sludge and slurry entering the continuous HTL while only 11 types were identified in the residual materials. No MPs were detected in the bio-crude, i.e. the most favorable product of the process. The polymer composition changed considerably as a result of the HTL process. Polyurethane, polypropylene, and polyethylene were the dominant polymers in the feedstock, while polypropylene and polyethylene were the most present in the residual products. The findings indicate that HTL can be efficient in reducing MPs in highly polluted sludge from wastewater treatment plants, leaving the byproducts and residuals significantly less polluted, hereby reducing the movement of MPs to the terrestrial environment. Thus the products are better suited for sustainability efforts than the raw material.","id":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.130383"}

{"text":"<p>Flavonoids play a key role in the regulation of plant-plant and plant-microbe interactions, and factors determining their release have been investigated in most of the common forage legumes. However, little is known about the response of flavonoid production and release to co-cultivation with other crop species. This study investigated alterations in the concentration of flavonoids in plant tissues and root exudates in four legumes [alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.), black medic (Medicago polymorpha L.), crimson clover (Trifolium incarnatum L.), and subterranean clover (Trifolium subterraneum L.)] co-cultivated with durum wheat [Triticum turgidum subsp. durum (Desf.) Husn.]. For this purpose, we carried out two experiments in a greenhouse, one with glass beads as growth media for root exudate extraction and one with soil as growth media for flavonoid detection in shoot and root biomass, using LC-MS/MS analysis. This study revealed that interspecific competition with wheat negatively affected legume growth and led to a significant reduction in shoot and root biomass compared with the same legume species grown in monoculture. In contrast, the concentration of flavonoids significantly increased both in legume biomass and in root exudates. Changes in flavonoid concentration involved daidzein, genistein, medicarpin, and formononetin, which have been found to be involved in legume nodulation and regulation of plant-plant interaction. We hypothesize that legumes responded to the co-cultivation with wheat by promoting nodulation and increasing exudation of allelopathic compounds, respectively, to compensate for the lack of nutrients caused by the presence of wheat in the cultivation system and to reduce the competitiveness of neighboring plants. Future studies should elucidate the bioactivity of flavonoid compounds in cereal-legume co-cultivation systems and their specific role in the nodulation process and inter-specific plant interactions such as potential effects on weeds.</p>","id":"10.1021/acs.jafc.1c02821"}

{"text":"Certain engineered nanoparticles (NPs) have unique properties that have exhibited significant potential for promoting photosynthesis and enhancing crop productivity. Understanding the fundamental interactions between NPs and plants is crucial for the sustainable development of nanoenabled agriculture. Leaf mesophyll protoplasts, which maintain similar physiological response and cellular activity as intact plants, were selected as a model system to study the impact of NPs on photosynthesis. The mesophyll protoplasts isolated from spinach were cultivated with different NMs (Fe, Mn3O4, SiO2, Ag, and MoS2) dosing at 50 mg/L for 2 h under illumination. The potential maximum quantum yield and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) production of mesophyll protoplasts were significantly increased by Mn3O4 and Fe NPs (23% and 43%, respectively), and were decreased by Ag and MoS2 NPs. The mechanism for the photosynthetic enhancement by Mn3O4 and Fe is to increase the photocurrent and electron transfer rate, as revealed by photoelectrochemical measurement. GC-MS based single cell type metabolomics reveal that NPs (Fe and MoS2) altered the metabolic profiles of mesophyll cells during 2 h of illumination period. Separately, the effect of NPs exposure on photosynthesis and biomass were also conducted at the whole plant level. A strong correlation was observed with protoplast data; plant biomass was significantly increased by Mn3O4 exposure (57%) but was decreased (24%) by treatment of Ag NPs. The use of mesophyll protoplasts can be a fast and reliable tool for screening NPs to enhance photosynthesis for potential nanofertilizer use. Importantly, inclusion of a metabolic analysis can provide mechanistic toxicity data to ensure the development 'safer-by-design' nanoenabled platforms.","id":"10.1021/acs.jafc.9b06429"}

{"text":"<p>The scale of root quantification in research is often limited by the time required for sampling, measurement and processing samples. Recent developments in Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have made faster and more accurate plant image analysis possible which may significantly reduce the time required for root measurement, but challenges remain in making these methods accessible to researchers without an in-depth knowledge of Machine Learning. We analyzed root images acquired from three destructive root samplings using the RootPainter CNN-software that features an interface for corrective annotation for easier use. Root scans with and without non-root debris were used to test if training a model, i.e., learning from labeled examples, can effectively exclude the debris by comparing the end-results with measurements from clean images. Root images acquired from soil profile walls and the cross-section of soil cores were also used for training and the derived measurements were compared with manual measurements. After 200 minutes of training on each dataset, significant relationships between manual measurements and RootPainter-derived data were noted for monolith (R<sup>2</sup>=0.99), profile wall (R<sup>2</sup>=0.76) and core-break (R<sup>2</sup>=0.57). The rooting density derived from images with debris was not significantly different from that derived from clean images after processing with RootPainter. Rooting density was also successfully calculated from both profile wall and soil core images, and in each case the gradient of root density with depth was not significantly different from manual counts. Differences in root-length density (RLD: cm cm<sup>-3</sup>) between crops with contrasting root systems were captured using automatic segmentation at soil profiles with high RLD (1 to 5 cm cm<sup>-3</sup>) as well as at low RLD (0.1 to 0.3 cm cm<sup>-3</sup>). Our results demonstrate that the proposed approach using CNN can lead to substantial reductions in root sample processing workloads, increasing the potential scale of future root investigations.</p>","id":"10.1093/jxb/erab174"}

{"text":"When rain falls on an existing cover of snow, followed by low temperatures, or falls as freezing rain, it can leave a hard crust. These Arctic rain on snow (ROS) events can profoundly influence the environment and in turn, human livelihoods. Impacts can be immediate (e.g. on human travel, herding, or harvesting) or evolve or accumulate, leading to massive starvation-induced die-offs of reindeer, caribou, and musk oxen, for example. We provide here a review and synthesis of Arctic ROS events and their impacts, addressing human-environment relationships, meteorological conditions associated with ROS events, and challenges in their detection. From our assessment of the state of the science, we conclude that while (a) systematic detection of ROS events, their intensity, and trends across the Arctic region can be approached by combining data from satellite remote sensing, atmospheric reanalyses, and meteorological station records; (b) obtaining knowledge and information most germane to impacts, such as the thickness of ice layers, how ice layers form within a snowpack, and antecedent conditions that can amplify impacts, necessitates collaboration and knowledge co-production with community members and indigenous knowledge-holders.","id":"10.1088/1748-9326/ac269b"}

{"text":"Open Accessand, on the economic and financial level, incorporation of both general incentives and subsidizing specific costs. This study contributes to the development and discussion of intervention proposals that are designed to stimulate the implementation of sustainable practices in agricultural soil management. Soil is a fundamental resource, subject to severe and quick degradation processes because of the pressure of human activities, particularly in many regions of the Mediterranean where agriculture is an important economic activity. It has been proven that the use of sustainable soil management practices can potentially give rise to the creation of a carbon sink, an increase of soil organic matter content, the maintenance of crop productivity and a reduction in erosion. Despite the existence of scientific evidence about the benefits generated by the use of sustainable practices on soil, many farmers are reluctant to adopt them. The objective of this study is to identify and give a hierarchical structure to the factors that condition the adoption of sustainable practices in the management of agricultural soil. The case of olive tree cultivation in Southeast Spain has been studied, using a participatory qualitative methodology. The results show a series of seven principal barriers (information, costs, risk aversion, characteristics of the farm and sustainable practices, macro factors, and cultural barriers) and five facilitators (technology, farmer training, awareness, incentives, and social pressure) for the adoption of the proposed sustainable agricultural practices. The principal political and legislative actions proposed to increase the adoption of sustainable agricultural practices include: administrative control, fostering environmental awareness, technical knowledge, and on-farm demonstrations","id":"10.3390/agronomy10040506"}

The AA, FCI, DDPH and ROO significantly vary with regards to the cultivar and the plant growth stage, showing interaction between the two experimental factors analyzed. The interaction detected showed higher values for the antioxidant traits of the proposed novel food, especially for the two broccoli cultivars in the sprout growth stage in comparison to the microgreens and baby leaves. Our results suggest that the antioxidant activity is partially dependent on kaempferol and apigenin. The PPH compounds showed the highest values of kaempferol and apigenin for &lsquo Ciocalteu index (FCI), and antioxidant activity (1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) and peroxyl radical (ROO)) variation during three different plant growth stages (sprouts, microgreens and baby leaves) of two broccoli types, the traditional Sicilian sprouting broccoli landrace (&lsquo Broccolo nero&rsquo Cavolo Broccolo Ramoso Calabrese&rsquo Broccolo Nero&rsquo Cavolo Lacinato Nero di Toscana&rsquo Cavolo broccolo Ramoso Calabrese&rsquo , whereas for the other two cultivars studied, only kaempferol was the main compound represented. The data acquired are of interest for increasing the healthy traits of the novel food proposed showing the contribution offered by the neglected LRs until now underutilized and at risk of extinction. The germplasm conserved in several world genebanks could support and diversify the organic vegetable items, providing us with added-value products for organic food supply chains.","id":"10.3390/agronomy10060782"}

{"text":"This review aimed to analyse the current state of management practices for poultry manure in Poland and present future perspectives in terms of technologies allowing closing the loops for circular economy, and thus recovery of nutrients and energy. The scope of the review focused primarily on: (1) the analysis of poultry production and generation of poultry manure with special references to quantities, properties (e.g. fertilizing properties), seasonality, etc.; (2) the overview of current practices and methods for managing poultry manure including advantages and limitations; (3) the analysis of potential and realistic threats and risk related to managing poultry manure, and also (4) the analysis of promising technologies for converting poultry manure into added value products and energy. The review addressed the following technologies: composting of poultry manure to obtain fertilizers and soil improvers, anaerobic digestion of poultry manure for energy recovery, and also pyrolysis of poultry manure into different types of biochar that can be applied in agriculture, horticulture and industry. Poultry manure is rich in macro- and micronutrients but also can contain various contaminants such as antibiotics or pesticides, and thus posing a realistic threat to soil and living organisms when applied to soil directly or after biological treatment. The main challenge in poultry manure processing is to assure sufficient closing of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorous loops and safe application to soil.","id":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2020.110327"}

However, the mineralization dynamics of organic matter (OM) stored in permafrost-affected soils remain unclear. We used physical soil fractionation, radiocarbon measurements, incubation experiments, and a dynamic decomposition model to identify distinct vertical pattern in OM decomposability. The observed differences reflect the type of OM input to the subsoil, either by cryoturbation or otherwise, e.g. by advective water-borne transport of dissolved OM. In non-cryoturbated subsoil horizons, most OM is stabilized at mineral surfaces or by occlusion in aggregates. In contrast, pockets of OM-rich cryoturbated soil contain sufficient free particulate OM for microbial decomposition. After thaw, OM turnover is as fast as in the upper active layer. Since cryoturbated soils store ca. 450 Pg carbon, identifying differences in decomposability according to such translocation processes has large implications for the future global carbon cycle and climate, and directs further process model development.</jats:p>","id":"10.1088/1748-9326/ac9198"}

[Scope] This paper provides an overview of the patterns of salinity heterogeneity in rain-fed and irrigated systems. We then discuss results from split-root studies and the recent progress in understanding the physiological and molecular mechanisms regulating plant responses to heterogeneous root-zone salinity and nutrient conditions. We focus on mechanisms by which plants (salt/nutrient sensing, root-shoot signalling and water uptake) could optimize the use of less-saline patches within the root-zone, thereby enhancing growth under heterogeneous soil salinity conditions. Finally, we place these findings in the context of defining future research priorities, possible irrigation management and crop breeding opportunities to improve productivity from salt-affected lands. [Background] Soil salinity, in both natural and managed environments, is highly heterogeneous, and understanding how plants respond to this spatiotemporal heterogeneity is increasingly important for sustainable agriculture in the era of global climate change. While the vast majority of research on crop response to salinity utilizes homogeneous saline conditions, a much smaller, but important, effort has been made in the past decade to understand plant molecular and physiological responses to heterogeneous salinity mainly by using split-root studies. These studies have begun to unravel how plants compensate for water/nutrient deprivation and limit salt stress by optimizing root-foraging in the most favourable parts of the soil.","id":"10.1093/aob/mcac022"}

{"text":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Rhizobial infection of legume roots during the development of nitrogen-fixing root nodules can occur intracellularly, through plant-derived infection threads traversing cells, or intercellularly, via bacterial entry between epidermal plant cells. Although it is estimated that around 25% of all legume genera are intercellularly infected, the pathways and mechanisms supporting this process have remained virtually unexplored due to a lack of genetically amenable legumes that exhibit this form of infection. In this study, we report that the model legume Lotus japonicus is infected intercellularly by the IRBG74 strain, recently proposed to belong to the Agrobacterium clade of the Rhizobiaceae. We demonstrate that the resources available for L. japonicus enable insight into the genetic requirements and fine-tuning of the pathway governing intercellular infection in this species. Inoculation of L. japonicus mutants shows that Ethylene-responsive factor required for nodulation 1 (Ern1) and Leu-rich Repeat Receptor-Like Kinase (RinRK1) are dispensable for intercellular infection in contrast to intracellular infection. Other symbiotic genes, including nod factor receptor 5 (NFR5), symbiosis receptor-like kinase (SymRK), Ca2+/calmodulin dependent kinase (CCaMK), exopolysaccharide receptor 3 (Epr3), Cyclops, nodule inception (Nin), nodulation signaling pathway 1 (Nsp1), nodulation signaling pathway 2 (Nsp2), cystathionine-\u03b2-synthase (Cbs), and Vapyrin are equally important for both entry modes. Comparative RNAseq analysis of roots inoculated with IRBG74 revealed a distinctive transcriptome response compared with intracellular colonization. In particular, several cytokinin-related genes were differentially regulated. Corroborating this observation, cyp735A and ipt4 cytokinin biosynthesis mutants were significantly affected in their nodulation with IRBG74, whereas lhk1 cytokinin receptor mutants formed no nodules. These results indicate a differential requirement for cytokinin signaling during intercellular rhizobial entry and highlight distinct modalities of inter- and intracellular infection mechanisms in L. japonicus.</jats:p>","id":"10.1093/plphys/kiaa049"}

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience We explored the timing of spring xylogenesis and its potential drivers in homogeneous mature forest stands in a temperate European region. Three species with contrasting leaf development dynamics and wood anatomy were studied: European beech, silver birch and pedunculate oak. Detailed phenological observations of xylogenesis and leaf phenology were performed from summer 2017 till spring 2018. Cambium reactivation (CR) occurred before the buds of oak and birch were swollen, whereas these two phenological phases were concurrent for beech. On the other hand, initial earlywood vessels were fully differentiated (FDIEV) after leaf unfolding for all three species. Timing of CR was correlated to average ring-width of the last 10\u00a0years (2017-2008), tree diameter, and, partially, with tree age. In addition, the timing of FDIEV was correlated to tree age and previous\u2019 year autumn phenology i.e., timing of wood growth cessation and onset of leaf senescence. Multivariate models could explain up to 68% of the variability of CR and 55% of the variability of FDIEV. In addition to the &quot;species&quot; factor, the variability could be explained by ca. 30% by tree characteristics and previous\u2019 years autumn phenology for both CR and FDIEV. These findings are important to better identify which factors (other than environment) can be driving the onset of the growing season and highlight the influence of tree growth characteristics and previous\u2019 year phenology on spring wood phenology, wood formation and, potentially, forest production.","id":"10.1093/treephys/tpaa171"}

{"text":"Open AccessUnderstanding the mechanisms that underlie species assembly is a central concern in community ecology. Abiotic and biotic filters are probabilistic \u2018sieves\u2019 that allow species with certain functional traits to become a part of the community, or not. We manipulated natural plant assemblies in order to identify variations in the timings of biotic and abiotic filters that determine community trait assemblies. We extracted soil portions when the investigated annual plant community was in its seed phase (\u2018community monolith\u2019), thereby maintaining the structure and similar soil characteristics to the field conditions. Community monoliths were subjected to experimental manipulation in terms of the rainfall timing and amount, and perturbations of the biological soil crust (BSC; intact vs. perturbed). We surveyed the experimental community assembly over time based on the functional diversity by considering important functional traits in different life stages. We found that autumn droughts acted as abiotic filters by favouring the germination and establishment of species with greater investment in the root biomass. Under severe droughts (66% water reduction), the experimental assemblies were dominated by species with functional traits adapted to water shortage conditions: high leaf dry matter content, low specific leaf area, small individual size, low reproductive ratio and high root:shoot ratio. We identified two roles of BSCs in annual plant species assemblies: (a) as a biotic filter that limited the establishment of species based on seed size, and (b) as a buffer against water stress conditions by reducing soil evapotranspiration. Synthesis. We demonstrated the importance of the timing and amount of rainfall for shaping annual plant communities, and identified germination filters as the main process that determined community assemblies. Our results suggest that the phenotypic integration of functional traits facilitates resistance to drought during the life cycle. The BSC\u2013annual plant relationship shifted from negative, by acting as a germination filter, to positive, by acting as a buffer in later stages. Climatic fluctuations and fine scale biotic determinants of spatial heterogeneity emerged as sources of changes in the community assembly in time and space to possibly promote species coexistence and trait differences among the communities studied.

These amazing structures are produced in phosphate\u2010deprived conditions and are made of hundreds of short roots also known as rootlets. White lupin is the only crop bearing CRs and is considered as the model species for CR studies. However, little information is available on CRs atypical development, including the molecular events that trigger their formation. To provide insights on CR formation, we performed an anatomical and cellular description of rootlet development in white lupin. Starting with a classic histological approach, we described rootlet primordium development and defined eight developmental stages from rootlet initiation to their emergence. Due to the major role of hormones in the developmental program of root system, we next focussed on auxin\u2010related mechanisms. We observed the establishment of an auxin maximum through rootlet development in transgenic roots expressing the <jats:italic>DR5:GUS</jats:italic> auxin reporter. Expression analysis of the main auxin\u2010related genes [TIR, Auxin Response Factor (ARF) and AUX/IAA] during a detailed time course revealed specific expression associated with the formation of the rootlet primordium.

{"text":"Open AccessAbstract Recent research shows that earthworms can alter defense traits of plants against herbivores and pathogens by affecting soil biochemistry. Yet, the effects of invasive earthworms on defense traits of native plants from previously earthworm\u2010free ecosystems as well as the consequences for multitrophic interactions are virtually unknown.Here we use a combination of an observational study and a complementary experimental study to investigate the effects of invasive earthworms on leaf defense traits, herbivore damage and pathogen infection in two poplar tree species (Populus balsamifera and Populus tremuloides) native to North American boreal forests.Our observational study showed that earthworm invasion was associated with enhanced leaf herbivory (by leaf\u2010chewing insects) in saplings of both tree species. However, we only detected significant shifts in the concentration of chemical defense compounds in response to earthworm invasion for P. balsamifera. Specifically, leaf phenolic concentrations, including salicinoids and catechin, were lower in P. balsamifera from earthworm\u2010invaded sites.Our experimental study confirmed an earthworm\u2010induced reduction in leaf defense levels in P. balsamifera for one of the defense compounds, tremulacin. The experimental study additionally showed that invasive earthworms reduced leaf dry matter content, potentially increasing leaf palatability, and enhanced susceptibility of trees to infection by a fungal pathogen, but not to aphid infestation, in the same tree species. Synthesis. Our results show that invasive earthworms can decrease the concentrations of some chemical defense compounds in P. balsamifera, which could make them susceptible to leaf\u2010chewing insects. Such potential impacts of invasive earthworms are likely to have implications for tree survival and competition, native tree biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Invasive earthworms can dramatically alter native biodiversity and ecosystem functioning. Yet, we know little how invasive earthworms affect the chemical defense of native trees. Here using a combination of observational and experimental studies, we show that invasive earthworms from Europe can decrease the concentrations of some chemical defense compounds in a native North American deciduous tree, which could make them susceptible to leaf\u2010chewing insects.","id":"10.1111/1365-2745.13504"}

{"text":"Open AccesspeerReviewed During the last few decades, a plethora of sequencing studies provided insight into fungal community composition under various environmental conditions. Still, the mechanisms of species assembly and fungal spread in soil remain largely unknown. While mycelial growth patterns are studied extensively, the abundant formation of asexual spores is often overlooked, though representing a substantial part of the fungal life cycle relevant for survival and dispersal. Here, we explore asexual sporulation (spore abundance, size and shape) in 32 co-occurring soil fungal isolates under varying resource conditions, to answer the question whether resource limitation triggers or inhibits fungal investment into reproduction. We further hypothesized that trade-offs exist in fungal investment towards growth, spore production and size. The results revealed overall increased fungal investment into spore production under resource limitations; however, effect sizes and response types varied strongly among fungal isolates. Such isolate-specific effects were apparent in all measured traits, resulting in unique trait spaces of individual isolates. This comprehensive dataset also elucidated variability in sporulation strategies and trade-offs with fungal growth and reproduction under resource scarcity, as only predicted by theoretical models before. The observed isolate-specific strategies likely underpin mechanisms of co-existence in this diverse group of saprobic soil fungi.","id":"10.1111/1462-2920.16012"}

{"text":"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>The rate of change (RoC) of environmental drivers matters: biotic and abiotic components respond differently when faced with a fast or slow change in their environment. This phenomenon occurs across spatial scales and thus levels of ecological organization. We investigated the RoC of environmental drivers in the ecological literature and examined publication trends across ecological levels, including prevalent types of evidence and drivers. Research interest in environmental driver RoC has increased over time (particularly in the last decade), however, the amount of research and type of studies were not equally distributed across levels of organization and different subfields of ecology use temporal terminology (e.g. \u2018abrupt\u2019 and \u2018gradual\u2019) differently, making it difficult to compare studies. At the level of individual organisms, evidence indicates that responses and underlying mechanisms are different when environmental driver treatments are applied at different rates, thus we propose including a time dimension into reaction norms. There is much less experimental evidence at higher levels of ecological organization (i.e. population, community, ecosystem), although theoretical work at the population level indicates the importance of RoC for evolutionary responses. We identified very few studies at the community and ecosystem levels, although existing evidence indicates that driver RoC is important at these scales and potentially could be particularly important for some processes, such as community stability and cascade effects. We recommend shifting from a categorical (e.g. abrupt <jats:italic>versus</jats:italic> gradual) to a quantitative and continuous (e.g. \u00b0C/h) RoC framework and explicit reporting of RoC parameters, including magnitude, duration and start and end points to ease cross\u2010scale synthesis and alleviate ambiguity. Understanding how driver RoC affects individuals, populations, communities and ecosystems, and furthermore how these effects can feed back between levels is critical to making improved predictions about ecological responses to global change drivers. The application of a unified quantitative RoC framework for ecological studies investigating environmental driver RoC will both allow cross\u2010scale synthesis to be accomplished more easily and has the potential for the generation of novel hypotheses.</jats:p>","id":"10.1111/brv.12639"}

{"text":"<jats:p>Retreating glaciers, icons of climate change, release new potential habitats for both aquatic and terrestrial organisms. High\u2010elevation species are threatened by temperature increases and the upward migration of lowlands species. Improving our understanding of successional processes after glacier retreat becomes urgent, especially in the tropics, where glacier shrinkage is particularly fast. We examined the successional patterns of aquatic invertebrates, ground beetles, terrestrial plants, soil eukaryotes (algae, invertebrates, plants) in an equatorial glacier foreland (Carihuairazo, Ecuador). Based on both taxonomical identification and eDNA metabarcoding, we analysed the effects of both environmental conditions and age of deglacierization on community composition. Except for algae, diversity increased with time since deglacierization, especially among passive dispersers, suggesting that dispersal was a key driver structuring the glacier foreland succession. Spatial \u03b2\u2010diversity was mainly attributed to nestedness for aquatic invertebrates, terrestrial plants and soil algae, likely linked to low environmental variability within the studied glacier foreland; and to turnover for soil invertebrates, suggesting competition exclusion at the oldest successional stage. Pioneer communities were dominated by species exhibiting flexible feeding strategies and high dispersal ability (mainly transported by wind), probably colonising from lower altitudes, or from the glacier in the case of algae. Overall, glacier foreland colonisation in the tropics exhibit common characteristics to higher latitudes. High\u2010elevation species are nevertheless threatened, as the imminent extinction of many tropical glaciers will affect species associated to glacier\u2010influenced habitats but also prevent cold\u2010adapted and hygrophilous species from using these habitats as refuges in a warming world.</jats:p>","id":"10.1111/ecog.05478"}

{"text":"Open AccessPeer reviewed 1. Dark diversity represents the set of species that can potentially inhabit a given area under particular ecological conditions, but are currently 'missing' from a site. This concept allows characterisation of the mechanisms determining why species are sometimes absent from an area that seems ecologically suitable for them. 2. The aim of this study was to determine the dark diversity of hoverflies in south-eastern Europe and to discuss the role of different functional traits that might increase the likelihood of species contributing to dark diversity. Based on expert opinion, the Syrph the Net database and known occurrences of species, the study estimated species pools, and observed and dark diversities within each of 11 defined vegetation types for 564 hoverfly species registered in south-eastern Europe. To detect the most important functional traits contributing to species being in dark diversity across different vegetation types, a random forest algorithm and respective statistics for variable importance were used. 3. The highest dark diversity was found for southwest Balkan sub-Mediterranean mixed oak forest type, whereas the lowest was in Mediterranean mixed forest type. Three larval feeding modes (saproxylic, and phytophagous on bulbs or roots) were found to be most important for determining the probability of a species contributing to hoverfly dark diversity, based on univariate correlations and random forest analysis. 4. This study shows that studying dark diversity might provide important insights into what drives community assembly in south-eastern European hoverflies, especially its missing components, and contributes to more precise conservation prioritisation of both hoverfly species and their habitats.","id":"10.1111/een.12788"}

{"text":"Closed AccessInternational audience Canopy leaf area, quantified by the leaf area index (L), is a crucial driver of forest productivity, water use and energy balance. Because L responds to environmental drivers, it can represent an important feedback to climate change, but its responses to rising atmospheric [CO2] and water availability of forests have been poorly quantified. We studied canopy leaf area dynamics for 28\u00a0months in a native evergreen Eucalyptus woodland exposed to free-air CO2 enrichment (the EucFACE experiment), in a subtropical climate where water limitation is common. We hypothesized that, because of expected stimulation of productivity and water-use efficiency, L should increase with elevated [CO2]. We estimated L from diffuse canopy transmittance, and measured monthly leaf litter production. Contrary to expectation, L did not respond to elevated [CO2]. We found that L varied between 1.10 and 2.20 across the study period. The dynamics of L showed a quick increase after heavy rainfall and a steady decrease during periods of low rainfall. Leaf litter production was correlated to changes in L, both during periods of decreasing L (when no leaf growth occurred) and during periods of increasing L (active shedding of old foliage when new leaf growth occurred). Leaf lifespan, estimated from mean L and total annual litter production, was up to 2\u00a0months longer under elevated [CO2] (1.18 vs. 1.01\u00a0years; P\u00a0=\u00a00.05). Our main finding that L was not responsive to elevated CO2 is consistent with other forest FACE studies, but contrasts with the positive response of L commonly predicted by many ecosystem models.","id":"10.1111/gcb.13151"}

{"text":"Abstract   Anaerobically digested agricultural waste, such as straw digestate, still consists of residual lignin and carbohydrates that may be utilised as substrate for sugars production and alcoholic fermentation. Chemical pretreatment combined with enzymatic hydrolysis was investigated as an alternative valorisation route for digestate. Acid pretreatment along with enzymatic hydrolysis was found to yield low sugars recoveries (2\u201339%), casting doubt on its suitability for ethanol production. In contrary, alkaline pretreatment and enzymatic hydrolysis is a better approach with elevated saccharification yields reaching up to 72%. Ethanol fermentation of alkaline pretreated digestate presented yields up to 65% consuming all the available glucose, implying that no inhibitory factors are present. Conclusively, according to the experimental results the perspective of a new integrated system is enforced. This system combines ethanol production with anaerobic digestion simultaneously producing energy in the form of ethanol and methane and improving the overall energy balance.","id":"10.1016/j.renene.2020.02.021"}

{"text":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Black carbon (BC) plays an important role in carbon burial in marine sediments globally. Yet the sequestration of BC in the Arctic Ocean is poorly understood. Here we assess the concentrations, fluxes, and sources of soot BC (SBC)\u2014the most refractory component of BC\u2014in sediments from the East Siberian Arctic Shelf (ESAS), the World's largest shelf sea system. SBC concentrations in the contemporary shelf sediments range from 0.1 to 2.1\u00a0mg\u00a0g<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>\u00a0dw, corresponding to 2\u201312% of total organic carbon. The <jats:sup>210</jats:sup>Pb\u2010derived fluxes of SBC (0.42\u201311\u00a0g\u00a0m<jats:sup>\u22122</jats:sup>\u00a0yr<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>) are higher or in the same range as fluxes reported for marine surface sediments closer to anthropogenic emissions. The total burial flux of SBC in the ESAS (~4,000\u00a0Gg\u00a0yr<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>) illustrates the great importance of this Arctic shelf in marine sequestration of SBC. The radiocarbon signal of the SBC shows more depleted yet also more uniform signatures (\u2212721 to \u2212896\u2030; average of \u2212774\u00a0\u00b1\u00a062\u2030) than of the non\u2010SBC pool (\u2212304 to \u2212728\u2030; average of \u2212491\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0163\u2030), suggesting that SBC is coming from an, on average, 5,900\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0300\u00a0years older and more specific source than the non\u2010SBC pool. We estimate that the atmospheric BC input to the ESAS is negligible (~0.6% of the SBC burial flux). Statistical source apportionment modeling suggests that the ESAS sedimentary SBC is remobilized by thawing of two permafrost carbon (PF/C) systems: surface soil permafrost (topsoil/PF; 25\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08%) and Pleistocene ice complex deposits (ICD/PF; 75\u00a0\u00b1\u00a08%). The SBC contribution to the total mobilized permafrost carbon (PF/C) increases with increasing distance from the coast (from 5 to 14%), indicating that the SBC is more recalcitrant than other forms of translocated PF/C. These results elucidate for the first time the key role of permafrost thaw in the transport of SBC to the Arctic Ocean. With ongoing global warming, these findings have implications for the biogeochemical carbon cycle, increasing the size of this refractory carbon pool in the Arctic Ocean.</jats:p>","id":"10.1002/2017GB005693"}

Differences in the functional properties between the two ingredients were found as the isoelectric precipitated ingredient showed lower protein solubilities over the investigated pH range (from 3 to 9) which can be linked to the slightly higher hydrophobicity values (2688.7) and total sulfhydryl groups (23.9 \u00b5M/g) found in this sample. In contrast, the protein ingredient obtained by ultrafiltration was superior with regard to its solubility (48.3%; pH 7), fat-binding capacity (2.24 g/g), water holding capacity (3.96 g/g), gelling properties (11%; w/w), and foam-forming capacity (69.6%).

The study (i) quantified the magnitude of variation in strength of European beech timber from stands of different composition and (ii) showed the impact of grading on the characteristic strength value of timber coming from those stands. Strength grading models and machine settings for hardwood tensile classes on over 900 European beech (<jats:italic>Fagus sylvatica</jats:italic> L.) boards were derived.

The yield of the material graded to the highest class in a class combination was higher in pure beech stands. The required characteristic strength values were mostly met for boards from the pure stands; while boards from the beech-pine mixed stands hardly ever reached the required values.

Many thanksto Dr. M.E. S\u00e1nchez (University of C\u00f3rdoba) for the critical review ofthe manuscrip The long-term conservation of Mediterranean mixed oak forests is seriously threatened by the massive mortality of Quercus suber caused by the exotic pathogen Phytophthora cinnamomi. This species frequently grows in mixed forests under natural conditions, but nothing is known about how its level of disease might be altered by the diversity and identity of coexisting neighbours varying in susceptibility to the exotic pathogen. Here we analysed the individual and combined effects of Q. suber and the main coexisting tree species (Quercus canariensis and Olea europaea subsp. europaea var. sylvestris) in mixed forests of southern Spain on the production of infective and survival spores of P. cinnamomi. Through in vitro experiments, it was demonstrated that mixtures of Q. suber and Q. canariensis highly stimulated the production of P. cinnamomi zoospores in comparison with both species in monocultures. Olea europaea did not stimulate zoospore production. Under controlled conditions, the initial and final densities of inoculum in soil planted with monocultures of O. europaea and Q. canariensis did not differ. However, inoculum densities significantly decreased along the experiment in Q. suber mixtures with O. europaea and Q. canariensis. Phytophthora cinnamomi was able to infect and cause root rot symptoms on all tree species, including O. europaea var. sylvestris. We concluded that mixed stands of Q. suber and Q. canariensis are able to stimulate P. cinnamomi infectivity and survival much more than monospecific stands, and consequently under favourable conditions for root disease development, the coexistence of Q. suber and Q. canariensis might exacerbate Mediterranean forests decline. This study also constitutes the first report of O. europaea var. sylvestris as host and inductor of P. cinnamomi sporulation under controlled conditions.","id":"10.1111/aab.12599"}

{"text":"Open AccessSoil Dynamics and Earthquake Engineering, 103 ISSN:1879-341X A series of prototype dynamic centrifuge experiments is carried out to investigate the influence of soil properties and structural parameters on the Soil Structure Interaction (SSI) effect. Established analytical models are herein experimentally verified, and are proven accurate in estimating the system's natural frequency characteristics. It is observed that period elongation is strongly correlated to the relative superstructure-foundation stiffness. Although the present study deals exclusively with the small-strain near-linear range, the experimental response indicates occurrence of nonlinearity. The identified damping results remarkably larger than its analytical estimate and proves highly strain-dependent, raising questions on the reliability of existing analytical methods in capturing the actual dissipation mechanisms. An extended experimental dataset is formed under realistic stress and strain soil conditions, and is implemented, for the first time, for verification of existing analytical models offering valuable insight into the theory and serving as a benchmark for engineering practice.

{"text":"Abstract   By utilizing continuous measurements of water fluxes and solar-induced chlorophyll fluorescence (SIF) over the entire growing season, we exploit the potential of broadband SIF in predicting plant transpiration (T) in a temperate forest. After reconstructing the full SIF spectrum from the selected absorption lines and simulations from the SCOPE (Soil Canopy Observation Photochemistry and Energy fluxes) model, linear regression (LR) and Gaussian processes regression (GPR) models are used to analyze the relation between T and combinations of different SIF bands. We find that SIF emissions in the near-infrared spectrum (at 720\u202fnm, 740\u202fnm and 760\u202fnm) are more sensitive to T than SIF emissions in the red spectrum (at 685\u202fnm and 687\u202fnm). While conditions such as light and heat stress decouple the relationship between single-band SIF and T, the combination of different SIF bands allows the retrieval of reliable T estimates even in these conditions. Overall, we find that the use of SIF as a proxy for T yields estimates that are at least as accurate as those from traditional transpiration models such as the Penman-Monteith equation, which are input demanding and complex to apply to in situ and satellite data. Specifically, we find that (1) the SIF-T relationship deteriorates when Photosynthetically Active Radiation (PAR), vapor pressure deficit and air temperature exceed biological optimal thresholds; (2) a high leaf area index exerts a negative impact on the SIF-T correlation due to increasing scattering and (re)absorption of the SIF signal; (3) the SIF-T relationship does not change depending on the observation time during the day; and (4) temporal aggregation to days further enhanced the SIF-T correlations. Altogether, our results provide the first ground-based evidence that SIF emission has potential to be a close predictor of plant transpiration, especially when a combination of different SIF bands is considered.","id":"10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.01.017"}

{"text":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The exponential rise of information available means we can now, in theory, access knowledge on almost any question we ask. However, as the amount of unverified information increases, so too does the challenge in deciding which information to trust. Farmers, when learning about agricultural innovations, have historically relied on in-person advice from traditional \u2018experts\u2019, such as agricultural advisers, to inform farm management. As more farmers go online for information, it is not clear whether they are now using digital information to corroborate in-person advice from traditional \u2018experts\u2019, or if they are foregoing \u2018expert\u2019 advice in preference for peer-generated information. To fill this knowledge gap, we sought to understand how farmers in two contrasting European countries (Hungary and the UK) learnt about sustainable soil innovations and who influenced them to innovate. Through interviews with 82 respondents, we found farmers in both countries regularly used online sources to access soil information; some were prompted to change their soil management by farmer social media \u2018influencers\u2019. However, online information and interactions were not usually the main factor influencing farmers to change their practices. Farmers placed most trust in other farmers to learn about new soil practices and were less trusting of traditional \u2018experts\u2019, particularly agricultural researchers from academic and government institutions, who they believed were not empathetic towards farmers\u2019 needs. We suggest that some farmers may indeed have had enough of traditional \u2018experts\u2019, instead relying more on their own peer networks to learn and innovate. We discuss ways to improve trustworthy knowledge exchange between agricultural stakeholders to increase uptake of sustainable soil management practices, while acknowledging the value of peer influence and online interactions for innovation and trust building.</jats:p>","id":"10.1007/s00267-021-01546-y"}

{"text":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Single bubble dynamics are of fundamental importance for understanding the underlying mechanisms in liquid\u2013vapor transition phenomenon known as cavitation. In the past years, numerous studies were published and results were extrapolated from one technique to another and further on to \u201creal-world\u201d cavitation. In the present paper, we highlight the issues of using various experimental approaches to study the cavitation bubble phenomenon and its effects. We scrutinize the transients bubble generation mechanisms behind tension-based and energy deposition-based techniques and overview the physics behind the bubble production. Four vapor bubble generation methods, which are most commonly used in single bubble research, are directly compared in this study: the pulsed laser technique, a high- and low-voltage spark discharge and the tube arrest method. Important modifications to the experimental techniques are implemented, demonstrating improvement of the bubble production range, control and repeatability. Results are compared to other similar techniques from the literature, and an extensive report on the topic is given in the scope of this work. Simple-to-implement techniques are presented and categorized herein, in order to help with future experimental design. Repeatability and sphericity of the produced bubbles are examined, as well as a comprehensive overview on the subject, listing the bubble production range and highlighting the attributes and limitation for the transient cavitation bubble techniques.</jats:p><jats:p><jats:bold>Graphic abstract</jats:bold></jats:p>","id":"10.1007/s00348-021-03260-1"}

{"text":"<jats:title>ABSTRACT</jats:title><jats:p>Operational earthquake forecasting protocols commonly use statistical models for their recognized ease of implementation and robustness in describing the short-term spatiotemporal patterns of triggered seismicity. However, recent advances on physics-based aftershock forecasting reveal comparable performance to the standard statistical counterparts with significantly improved predictive skills when fault and stress-field heterogeneities are considered. Here, we perform a pseudoprospective forecasting experiment during the first month of the 2019 Ridgecrest (California) earthquake sequence. We develop seven Coulomb rate-and-state models that couple static stress-change estimates with continuum mechanics expressed by the rate-and-state friction laws. Our model parameterization supports a gradually increasing complexity; we start from a preliminary model implementation with simplified slip distributions and spatially homogeneous receiver faults to reach an enhanced one featuring optimized fault constitutive parameters, finite-fault slip models, secondary triggering effects, and spatially heterogenous planes informed by pre-existing ruptures. The data-rich environment of southern California allows us to test whether incorporating data collected in near-real time during an unfolding earthquake sequence boosts our predictive power. We assess the absolute and relative performance of the forecasts by means of statistical tests used within the Collaboratory for the Study of Earthquake Predictability and compare their skills against a standard benchmark epidemic-type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model for the short (24\u00a0hr after the two Ridgecrest mainshocks) and intermediate terms (one month). Stress-based forecasts expect heightened rates along the whole near-fault region and increased expected seismicity rates in central Garlock fault. Our comparative model evaluation not only supports that faulting heterogeneities coupled with secondary triggering effects are the most critical success components behind physics-based forecasts, but also underlines the importance of model updates incorporating near-real-time available aftershock data reaching better performance than standard ETAS. We explore the physical basis behind our results by investigating the localized shut down of pre-existing normal faults in the Ridgecrest near-source area.</jats:p>","id":"10.1785/0120200028"}

{"text":"Main conclusion: Different nitrogen forms affect different metabolic pathways in lichens. In particular, the most relevant changes in protein expression were observed in the fungal partner, with NO3\u2212mostly affecting the energetic metabolism and NH4+affecting transport and regulation of proteins and the energetic metabolism much more than NO3\u2212did.Excess deposition of reactive nitrogen is a well-known agent of stress for lichens, but which symbiont is most affected and how, remains a mystery. Using proteomics can expand our understanding of stress effects on lichens. We investigated the effects of different doses and forms of reactive nitrogen, with and without supplementary phosphorus and potassium, on the proteome of the lichen Cladonia portentosa growing in a \u2018real-world\u2019 simulation of nitrogen deposition. Protein expression changed with the nitrogen treatments but mostly in the fungal partner, with NO3\u2212 mainly affecting the energetic metabolism and NH4+ also affecting the protein synthesis machinery. The photobiont mainly responded overexpressing proteins involved in energy production. This suggests that in response to nitrogen stress, the photobiont mainly supports the defensive mechanisms initiated by the mycobiont with an increased energy production. Such surplus energy is then used by the cell to maintain functionality in the presence of NO3\u2212, while a futile cycle of protein production can be hypothesized to be induced by NH4+ excess. External supply of potassium and phosphorus influenced differently the responses of particular enzymes, likely reflecting the many processes in which potassium exerts a regulatory function.","id":"10.1007/s00425-017-2647-2"}

{"text":"Abstract   This paper presents a novel, bridge-dependent approach for quantifying the increase of design quantities due to spatially variable earthquake ground motion (SVEGM). Contrary to the existing methods for multiple support bridge excitation analysis that are either too complicated to be applied by most practitioners or oversimplied (e.g. Eurocode 8, Annex D provisions), this method aims to strike a balance between simplicity, accuracy and computational efficiency. The method deliberately avoids generating support-dependent, acceleration or displacement, asynchronous inputs for the prediction of bridge response. The reasons behind this decision are twofold: (a) first, the uncertainty associated with the generation of asynchronous motion scenarios, as well as the exact soil properties, stratification and topography is high while, (b) the response of a bridge is particularly sensitive to the above due to the large number of natural modes involved. It is therefore prohibitive to address SVEGM effects deterministically in the framework of a design code. Instead, this new method is based on two important and well-documented observations: (a) that SVEGM is typically globally beneficial but locally detrimental [1], and (b) that the local seismic demand increase is very closely correlated with the excitation of higher modes, which are not normally activated in the case of uniform ground motion [2,3]. Along these lines, a set of static analyses are specified herein to complement the standard, code-based response spectrum analysis. These static analyses apply spatially distributed lateral forces, whose patterns match the shape of potentially excited anti-symmetric modes. The amplitude of those forces is derived as a function of the expected amplification of these modes according to the process initially proposed by Price et al. [4]. Two real bridges with different structural configurations are used as a test-bed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the new method. Comparison of the results with those obtained through rigorous response history analysis using partially correlated, spatially variable, spectrum-compatible input motions [5] shows that, the simplified method presented herein provides a reasonably accurate estimation of the SVEGM impact on the response of the bridges examined at a highly reduced computational cost. This is essentially an elastic method that is found to be simple, yet precise enough to consist an attractive alternative for the design and assessment of long and/or important bridge structures in earthquake-prone regions.","id":"10.1016/j.soildyn.2019.106013"}

{"text":"Abstract   Smouldering peat fires are reported across continents and their emissions result in regional haze crisis (large scale accumulation of smoke at low altitudes) and large carbon foot prints. Inorganic content (IC) and bulk density vary naturally in peatlands and are among the important parameters governing peat fires. However, their roles in fire emissions remain unknown. In this work, bench-scale burning of sphagnum peat conditioned to different values of IC and bulk densities were conducted in the laboratory environment. Mass loss rate, spread rate and transient emissions of 20 gas species and particles (PM10, PM2.5 and PM1) were simultaneously investigated. We found that peat with 50% moisture content can self-sustain smouldering propagation if IC is less than 40%, or its bulk density is lower than 287.5\u202fkg\u202fm\u22123. Increasing IC or bulk density decreases peat mass loss rate and spread rate. High IC peat releases lower gas fluxes (especially for CH4 and NH3) throughout the experiment. In the ignition stage, increasing IC leads to an increase in particles with diameter between 1 and 2.5\u202f\u03bcm; in the fire spread stage, IC has no influence on the particle fluxes. In contrast, increasing bulk density delays both gas and particle emission fluxes without altering the smoke composition significantly. The fundamental understanding of how soil properties affect peat wildfires facilitates the development of mitigation technologies against haze.","id":"10.1016/j.firesaf.2019.102940"}

{"text":"Background and Aims  This study analysed the effect of row direction on photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) absorption (APAR) and the fraction of PAR absorbed (fPAR) on both a daily and hourly temporal scale in vertical shoot positioned trellised vineyards.    Methods and Results  The analysis included experimental data and model simulations. The data of fPAR and APAR were acquired in commercial plots with a range of canopy development and with row directions near to the north\u2013south, northeast\u2013southwest and east\u2013west orientations. Simulated values of fPAR and APAR were calculated for north\u2013south, northeast\u2013southwest, northwest\u2013southeast and east\u2013west row directions and for a range of geographical latitudes, from 30 to 50\u00b0N to represent the wide range of latitudes where grapes are grown round the world. In agreement with previous research, the results confirm the strong daily variation of fPAR and APAR, and the instantaneous values of these parameters are not representative of the daily period in row vineyards. The field data and model results suggest the advantage of the north\u2013south and northeast\u2013southwest row orientations to maximise PAR absorption for latitudes between 30 and 50\u00b0N. And the exploratory analysis based on model simulation indicates that PAR absorption is lower for the east\u2013west row direction in all latitudes analysed.    Conclusions  The interrelations between radiation regimen and physiological aspects related to climatic limitations in canopy conductance result in a relative advantage of the north\u2013south and northeast\u2013southwest row directions against other orientations in arid and semi-arid environments.    Significance of the Study  The determination of the potential PAR absorption for a given vineyard training system enables a good first step towards understanding the effect of canopy management on vineyard productivity. In addition, these results are of interest for plot design and simulation of vineyard development.","id":"10.1111/ajgw.12246"}

{"text":"Closed AccessInternational audience The loess and paleosol sequences of the Chinese Loess Plateau are composed of Quaternary dust, the origin of which has been the subject of considerable debate. Some recent U-Pb geochronological studies of eolian zircons have proposed the existence of two major wind pathways: from the north and northwest, through the Badan Jaran, Tengger, and Mu Us Deserts during interglacials, and from the west, through the Qaidam Basin during glacials. Others have emphasized the importance of Yellow River sediment supply in the Chinese Loess Plateau sediment budget. However, tracking dust source regions through U-Pb dating in a statistically robust manner is particularly complex given the similar age peaks in the age probability distributions of potential source regions in Central Asia. This paper pre sents 2410 new U-Pb ages of detrital zircons from wind-eroded strata, Quaternary eolian deposits, and modern river sands in central China in order to increase the robustness and the spatial resolution of zircon age distributions in dust source regions. We then propose a new mixture modeling technique to statistically address the contribution of these different sources to the Chinese Loess Plateau sedimentary budget. Our contribution estimates indicate that eolian supply to the Chinese Loess Plateau is dominated (60%-70%) by reworking of Yellow River sediment. Moreover, evidence of Qaidam Basin-sourced zircons (15%-20%) in both loess (glacial) and paleosol (interglacial) layers corroborates the existence of an erosive wind pathway through the Qaidam Basin during glacials and implies that a substantial portion of the interglacial dust is recycled from older glacial loess. We propose that sediment reworking of Yellow River sediment and older loess deposits by wind on the Chinese Loess Plateau homogenized the eolian zircon populations toward a glacial provenance due to higher (2-20 times) dust accumulation rates during glacials. These findings suggest that the Chinese Loess Plateau has evolved as a more dynamic landform than previous thought, where wind deflation, fluvial input, lateral transport, and accumulation of sediment are equally important. These internal reworking effects would then significantly bias the paleoclimatic interpretations based on eolian dust properties of the Chinese Loess Plateau.","id":"10.1130/B31375.1"}

{"text":"Primary productivity is in the foundation of farming communities. Therefore, much effort is invested in understanding the factors that influence the primary productivity potential of different soils. The International Long-Term Ecological Research (ILTER) is a network that enables valuable comparisons of data in understanding environmental change. In this study, we investigate three ILTER cropland sites and one long-term field experiment (LTE) outside of the ILTER network. The focus is on the influence of different management practices (tillage, crop residue incorporation, and compost amendments) on primary productivity. Data mining analyses of the experimental data were carried out in order to investigate trends in the productivity data. We generated predictive models that identify the influential factors that govern primary productivity. The data mining models achieved very high predictive performance (r\u2009>\u20090.80) for each of the sites. Preceding crop and crop of the current year were crucial for primary productivity in the tillage LTE and compost LTE, respectively. For both crop residue incorporation LTEs, plant-available Mg affected productivity the most, followed by properties such as soil pH, SOM, and the crop residue management. The results obtained by data mining are in line with previous studies and enhance our knowledge about the driving forces of primary productivity in arable systems. Hence, the models are considered very suitable and reliable for predicting the primary productivity at these ILTER sites in the future. They may also encourage researcher-farmer-advisor-stakeholder interaction, and thus create enabling environment for cooperation for further research around these ILTER sites.","id":"10.1007/s10113-018-1361-3"}

The study of the food microbiome has gained considerable interest in recent years, mainly due to the wide range of applications that can be derived from the analysis of metagenomes. Among these applications, it is worth mentioning the possibility of using metagenomic analyses to determine food authenticity, to assess the microbiological safety of foods thanks to the detection and tracking of pathogens, antibiotic resistance genes and other undesirable traits, as well to identify the microorganisms responsible for food processing defects. Metataxonomics and metagenomics are currently the gold standard methodologies to explore the full potential of metagenomes in the food industry. However, there are still a number of challenges that must be solved in order to implement these methods routinely in food chain monitoring, and for the regulatory agencies to take them into account in their opinions. These challenges include the difficulties of analysing foods and food-related environments with a low microbial load, the lack of validated bioinformatics pipelines adapted to food microbiomes and the difficulty of assessing the viability of the detected microorganisms. This review summarizes the methods of microbiome analysis that have been used, so far, in foods and food-related environments, with a specific focus on those involving Next-Generation Sequencing technologies.","id":"10.1007/s10123-021-00215-8"}

{"text":"Abstract   Food waste has important environmental, social and economic impacts and increasing attention has been given lately to the unparalleled scale of food waste in the food supply chain worldwide. An initiative aiming to reduce food waste was tested at the School of Agriculture canteen (University of Lisbon, Portugal). The \u201cClean dish, clean conscience!\u201d initiative consisted of a simple and inexpensive education campaign to raise awareness of reducing plate waste, by establishing the connection between food waste and personal behaviour. As a first stage plate waste from canteen users was measured over a 10\u202fday period. After this period, a waste consumption index and per capita waste consumption were calculated to evaluate the level of satisfaction of the consumer and the related concern about food wastage, and was classified as Bad. After this first stage it was concluded that the users did not have strong convictions about avoiding food waste. During the second stage of the project an education campaign was implemented with plate waste being monitored for a further 16\u202fdays to assess the effectiveness of the campaign. The approach consisted of displaying simple and affordable informative posters in strategic areas of the canteen with simple messages reminding not to accept food they knew they would not eat. This led to a mean reduction in the waste consumption index of \u223c15%. A parallel action encouraging separation of organic and inorganic waste was implemented as well, with an active participation of >70% of the users. The initiative achieved its objective of reducing plate waste by raising awareness of the daily food waste problem at the institution\u2019s canteen and by suggesting \u201chow-to\u201d actions for reducing such waste. This study showed how avoidable waste can be reduced simply by making students aware of the topic of food waste. Simple strategies may be useful to improve behaviours and increase sustainability of the canteens at Universities although this proved to be only efficient with the collaboration of the canteen staff that needs solid education. From the results, a set of measures was presented to the University Social Services for adoption to ensure a permanent reduction of food waste and recyclables in the University canteens.","id":"10.1016/j.wasman.2018.02.044"}

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience Modeling soil evaporation has been a notorious challenge due to the complexity of the phenomenon and the lack of data to constrain it. In this context, a parsimonious model is developed to estimate soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) defined as the ratio of actual to potential soil evaporation. It uses a soil resistance driven by surface (0-5 cm) soil moisture, meteorological forcing and time (hour) of day, and has the capability to be calibrated using the radiometric surface temperature derived from remotely sensed thermal data. The new approach is tested over a rainfed semi-arid site, which had been under bare soil conditions during a 9-month period in 2016. Three calibration strategies are adopted based on SEE time series derived from (1) eddy-covariance measurements , (2) thermal measurements, and (3) eddy-covariance measurements used only over separate drying periods between significant rainfall events. The correlation coefficients (and slopes of the linear regression) between simulated and observed (eddy-covariance-derived) SEE are 0.85, 0.86 and 0.87 (and 0.91, 0.87 and 0.91) for calibration strategies 1, 2 and 3, respectively. Moreover, the correlation coefficient (and slope of the linear regression) between simulated and observed SEE is improved from 0.80 to 0.85 (from 0.86 to 0.91) when including hour of day in the soil resistance. The reason is that, under non-energy-limited conditions, the receding evaporation front during daytime makes SEE decrease at the hourly time scale. The soil resistance formulation can be integrated into state-of-the-art dual-source surface models and has calibration capabilities across a range of spatial scales from spaceborne microwave and thermal data.","id":"10.1016/j.agrformet.2018.04.010"}

{"text":"Although concerns surrounding microplastics (MPs) in terrestrial ecosystems have been growing in recent years, little is known about the responses of plant growth to MPs pollution. Here, we conducted a pot experiment in a net house under natural condition by adding two types of MPs, low-density polyethylene (LDPE-MPs) and polylactic acid (PLA) mixed with poly-butylene-adipate-co-terephthalate (PBAT, Bio-MPs), to sandy soil at 5 doses (0.5%, 1.0%, 1.5%, 2.0%, 2.5% \u03c9/\u03c9 dry soil weight). The effects of LDPE-MPs and Bio-MPs on common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L) were tested. Compared to control (no MPs addition), LDPE-MPs showed no significant effects on shoot, root and fruit biomass while \u22651.0% LDPE-MPs showed significant higher specific root nodules (n\u00b7g\u22121 dry root biomass) and only 2.5% LDPE-MPs showed significant higher specific root length (cm\u00b7g\u22121 dry root biomass). 1.0% LDPE-MPs caused significant higher leaf area and 0.5% LDPE-MPs caused significant lower leaf relative chlorophyll content. For Bio-MPs treatment, compared to control, \u22651.5% Bio-MPs showed significant lower shoot and root biomass. \u22652.0% Bio-MPs showed significant lower leaf area and fruit biomass. All Bio-MPs treatments showed significant higher specific root length and specific root nodules as compared to control. The results of the current research show that both MPs induced the responses of common bean growth, and \u22651.5% Bio-MPs exerted stronger effects.

{"text":"Open AccessISSN:0013-936X Environmental Science & Technology, 55 (5) Mercury (Hg) is a toxic trace element of global environmental concern which has been increasingly dispersed into the environment since the industrial revolution. In aquatic and terrestrial systems, Hg can be reduced to elemental Hg (Hg0) and escape to the atmosphere or converted to methylmercury (MeHg), a potent neurotoxin that accumulates in food webs. FeII-bearing minerals such as magnetite, green rusts, siderite, and mackinawite are recognized HgII reducers. Another potentially Hg-reducing mineral, which commonly occurs in Fe- and organic/P-rich sediments and soils, is the ferrous iron phosphate mineral vivianite (FeII3(PO4)2\u00b78H2O), but its reaction with HgII has not been studied to date. Here, nanoparticulate vivianite (particle size \u223c 50 nm; FeII content > 98%) was chemically synthesized and characterized by a combination of chemical, spectroscopic, and microscopic analyses. Its ability to reduce HgII was investigated at circumneutral pH under anoxic conditions over a range of FeII/HgII ratios (0.1\u20131000). For FeII/HgII ratios \u22651, which are representative of natural environments, HgII was very quickly and efficiently reduced to Hg0. The ability of vivianite to reduce HgII was found to be similar to those of carbonate green rust and siderite, two of the most effective Hg-reducing minerals. Our results suggest that vivianite may be involved in abiotic HgII reduction in Fe and organic/P-rich soils and sediments, potentially contributing to Hg evasion while also limiting MeHg formation in these ecosystems.

{"text":"The chlorinated nitroaromatic antibiotic chloramphenicol (CAP) is a refractory contaminant that is widely present in various environments. However, few CAP-mineralizing bacteria have been documented, and a complete CAP catabolism pathway has yet to be identified. In this study, the bacterial strain Sphingobium sp. CAP-1 was isolated from an activated sludge sample and was shown to be capable of aerobically subsisting on CAP as the sole carbon, nitrogen, and energy source while simultaneously and efficiently degrading CAP. p-Nitrobenzoic acid (PNBA), p-nitrobenzaldehyde (PNBD), protocatechuate (PCA), and the novel side chain C3-hydroxy-oxygenated product of CAP (O-CAP) were identified during CAP degradation. Strain CAP-1 was able to convert O-CAP to intermediate product PNBA. The putative functional genes associated with PNBA catabolism into the tricarboxylic acid cycle via PCA and floc formation were also identified by genome sequencing and comparative proteome analysis. A complete pathway for CAP catabolism was proposed. The discovery of a novel CAP oxidation/detoxification process and a complete pathway for CAP catabolism enriches the fundamental understanding of the bacterial catabolism of antibiotics, providing new insights into the microbial-mediated fate, transformation, and resistance risk of CAP in the environment. The molecular basis of CAP catabolism and floc formation in strain CAP-1 also offers theoretical guidance for the enhanced bioremediation of CAP-containing environments.","id":"10.1021/acs.est.9b07324"}

{"text":"Recently, <i>Vulpia myuros</i> has become a problematic grass weed species in parts of Europe. It is most common in no-till cropping systems. The inherent tolerance to several selective grass weed herbicides is of serious concern to the successful management of <i>V. myuros</i> in arable farming. Here, we reviewed the available knowledge about the biology of <i>V. myuros</i> to identify knowledge gaps and assess management efforts to identify best practices for control. <i>V. myuros</i> is a winter-annual species producing seeds with a short dormancy that can germinate at a wide range of conditions. Seed longevity in the soil is short. Little information is available on the influence of <i>V. myuros</i> on crop yield but some results suggest that yield losses can be significant. The findings provide a better understanding of the weedy characteristics of <i>V. myuros</i> and highlight that management strategies in Europe need to be diversified and integrate preventive and cultural control methods. Finally, we identify some of the management tools that should be considered to minimize the impact of <i>V. myuros</i> on European farming and future needs for research to develop sustainable integrated weed management strategies.","id":"10.3390/plants9060715"}

{"text":"Abstract   We examined two measures of shade tolerance (survival and growth) of planted 1-year-old seedlings of western redcedar (Thuja plicata (Donn ex D. Don)), western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla ([Raf.] Sarg.)) and amabilis fir (Abies amabilis ([Dougl. ex Loud] Dougl. ex Forbes)). Seedlings were planted at two different sites (forest interior: 4.5% mean above canopy photosynthetically active radiation [ACPAR], and forest edge: 41.5% mean ACPAR), in a 90-year-old, windthrow origin, unmanaged mesic western hemlock-amabilis fir stand. Seedlings were planted in 1997, and re-measured in 1998 and 2001 (after five growing seasons). To assess the effects of deer browsing on redcedar survival and growth, additional seedlings of this species were planted and protected with Vexar\u00a9 tubes. To examine for nutrient-light interactions, half of these seedlings were fertilized with N-P-K and micronutrients at planting. Western redcedar had high levels of survival after 4\u00a0years (98% in edge plots and 93% in interior plots). Redcedar seedlings in edge plots were more vigorous but were browsed more heavily than in the interior plots. At edge sites, the negative effects of the Vexar\u00a9 tubes may have been lower than their positive effects. Hemlock survival was about 50% in the stand interior but 80% in the edge plots. Amabilis fir in the interior plots had the lowest survival of the three species, with only 40% of initial seedlings surviving over the next four years, but had high survival in edge plots (95%). Height, biomass, and root collar diameter growth were significantly higher in edge plots for fir and hemlock. However, for redcedar, only biomass was significantly higher and no differences were detected for height and diameter. Our results show that shade tolerance cannot be assessed by simple measures of leaf/light relationships alone, but also requires consideration of light, nutrition, growth and browsing.","id":"10.1016/j.foreco.2016.11.019"}

{"text":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Plant species exert a dominant control over the nitrogen (N) cycle of natural and managed grasslands. Although in intensively managed systems that receive large external N inputs the emission of the potent greenhouse gas nitrous oxide (N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O) is a crucial component of this cycle, a mechanistic relationship between plant species and N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions has not yet been established. Here we use a plant functional trait approach to study the relation between plant species strategies and N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions from soils. Compared to species with conservative strategies, species with acquisitive strategies have higher N uptake when there is ample N in the soil, but also trigger N mineralization when soil N is limiting. Therefore, we hypothesized that (1) compared to conservative species, species with acquisitive traits reduce N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions after a high N addition; and (2) species with conservative traits have lower N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions than acquisitive plants if there is no high N addition. This was tested in a greenhouse experiment using monocultures of six grass species with differing above\u2010 and below\u2010ground traits, growing across a gradient of soil N availability. We found that acquisitive species reduced N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions at all levels of N availability, produced higher biomass and showed larger N uptake. As such, acquisitive species had 87% lower N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions per unit of N uptake than conservative species (<jats:italic>p\u00a0</jats:italic>&lt;<jats:italic>\u00a0</jats:italic>.05). Structural equation\u00a0modelling revealed that specific leaf area and root length density were key traits regulating the effects of plants on N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emission and biomass productivity. These results provide the first framework to understand the mechanisms through which plants modulate N<jats:sub>2</jats:sub>O emissions, pointing the way to develop productive grasslands that contribute optimally to climate change mitigation.</jats:p>","id":"10.1111/gcb.13827"}

{"text":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The land surface controls the partitioning of water and energy fluxes and therefore plays a crucial role in the climate system. The coupling between soil moisture and air temperature, in particular, has been shown to affect the severity and occurrence of temperature extremes and heat waves. Here we study soil moisture\u2010temperature coupling in five land surface models, focusing on the terrestrial segment of the coupling in the warm season. All models are run off\u2010line over a common period with identical atmospheric forcing data, in order to allow differences in the results to be attributed to the models' partitioning of energy and water fluxes. Coupling is calculated according to two semiempirical metrics, and results are compared to observational flux tower data. Results show that the locations of the global hot spots of soil moisture\u2010temperature coupling are similar across all models and for both metrics. In agreement with previous studies, these areas are located in transitional climate regimes. The magnitude and local patterns of model coupling, however, can vary considerably. Model coupling fields are compared to tower data, bearing in mind the limitations in the geographical distribution of flux towers and the differences in representative area of models and in situ data. Nevertheless, model coupling correlates in space with the tower\u2010based results (<jats:italic>r</jats:italic> = 0.5\u20130.7), with the multimodel mean performing similarly to the best\u2010performing model. Intermodel differences are also found in the evaporative fractions and may relate to errors in model parameterizations and ancillary data of soil and vegetation characteristics.</jats:p>","id":"10.1002/2017JD027346"}

However, we still lack a synthetic understanding of the underlying mechanisms behind these changes, such as whether earthworm effects on soil chemical properties drive such relationships. Here, we investigated the effects of invasive earthworms on soil chemical properties (pH, water content, and the stocks and fluxes of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus) by conducting a meta\u2010analysis. Invasive earthworms generally increased soil pH, indicating that the removal of organic layers and the upward transport of more base\u2010rich mineral soil caused a shift in soil pH. Moreover, earthworms significantly decreased soil water content, suggesting that the burrowing activities of earthworms may have increased water infiltration of and/or increased evapotranspiration from soil. Notably, invasive earthworms had opposing effects on organic and mineral soil for carbon and nitrogen stocks, with decreases in organic, and increases in mineral soil. Nitrogen fluxes were higher in mineral soil, whereas fluxes in organic soil were not significantly affected by the presence of invasive earthworms, indicating that earthworms mobilize and redistribute nutrients among soil layers and increase overall nitrogen loss from the soil. Invasive earthworm effects on element stocks increased with ecological group richness only in organic soil. Earthworms further decreased ammonium stocks with negligible effects on nitrate stocks in organic soil, whereas they increased nitrate stocks but not ammonium stocks in mineral soil. Notably, all of these results were consistent across forest and grassland ecosystems underlining the generality of our findings. However, we found some significant differences between studies that were conducted in the field (observational and experimental settings) and in the lab, such as that the effects on soil pH decreased from field to lab settings, calling for a careful interpretation of lab findings. Our meta\u2010analysis provides strong empirical evidence that earthworm invasion may lead to substantial changes in soil chemical properties and element cycling in soil. Furthermore, our results can help explain the dramatic effects of invasive earthworms on native biodiversity, for example, shifts towards the dominance of grass species over herbaceous ones, as shown by recent meta\u2010analyses.","id":"10.1002/ecy.2936"}

{"text":"<jats:title>Summary</jats:title><jats:p>Response\u2010history nonlinear dynamic analysis is an analytical tool that often sees use in risk\u2010oriented earthquake engineering applications. In the context of performance\u2010based earthquake engineering, dynamic analysis serves to obtain a probabilistic description of seismic structural vulnerability. This typically involves subjecting a nonlinear numerical computer model to a set of ground\u2010motions that represent a sample of possible realizations of base acceleration at the site of interest. The analysis results are then used to calibrate a stochastic model that describes structural response as a function of shaking intensity. The sample size of the ground\u2010motion record set is nowadays usually governed by computation\u2010demand constraints, yet it directly affects the uncertainty in estimation of seismic response.

{"text":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We combine high\u2010resolution soil sampling with lead (Pb) analyses (concentrations and stable isotopes) in two temperate podzols, together with previous data obtained with selective Al and Fe dissolution techniques. We aim to assess how atmospheric Pb is incorporated into the soils during pedogenesis. Partial least squares modelling for Pb concentrations shows that the podzolization process has the largest effect on Pb concentration (80\u00b73% of the variance). The proportion of inorganic secondary compounds, the input of fresh organic matter from the soil surface and the relative abundance of Fe versus Al are responsible for a small part of the Pb concentration variance. Lead isotopic composition (<jats:sup>206</jats:sup>Pb/<jats:sup>207</jats:sup>Pb ratios) depends on soil organic matter content either fresh/poorly humified (57\u00b73% of the variance) or humified (24\u00b77% of the variance). The Pb linked to inorganic compounds and the overall podzolization process play a minor role in isotopic signature (5\u00b73 and 3\u00b77% of the variance respectively). Soil pH appears to be the controlling variable of the different transport and retention mechanisms. The relatively low isotopic ratios observed in spodic horizons result from geogenic Pb released through the preferential dissolution of the isotopically distinct most weatherable minerals of the parent material in the eluvial horizons, which undergoes downward mobilization. An accurate knowledge of soil reactive components and formation mechanisms is essential to a correct diagnose of the scope of Pb pollution and a more effective design of remediation strategies.

{"text":"Open AccessISSN:1879-0682 Renewable Energy, 170 We propose a data-driven model to predict the short-term fatigue Damage Equivalent Loads (DEL) on a wake-affected wind turbine based on wind field inflow sensors and/or loads sensors deployed on an adjacent up-wind wind turbine. Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) with Bayesian hyperparameters calibration is proposed to obtain a surrogate from input random variables to output DELs in the blades and towers of the up-wind and wake-affected wind turbines. A sensitivity analysis based on the hyperparameters of the GPR and Kullback-Leibler divergence is conducted to assess the effect of different input on the obtained DELs. We provide qualitative recommendations for a minimal set of necessary and sufficient input random variables to minimize the error in the DEL predictions on the wake-affected wind turbine. Extensive simulations are performed comprising different random variables, including wind speed, turbulence intensity, shear exponent and inflow horizontal skewness. Furthermore, we include random variables related to the blades lift and drag coefficients with direct impact on the rotor aerodynamic induction, which governs the evolution and transport of the meandering wake. In addition, different spacing between the wind turbines and W\u00f6hler exponents for calculation of DELs are considered. The maximum prediction normalized mean squared error, obtained in the tower base DELs in the fore-aft direction of the wake affected wind turbine, is less than 4%. In the case of the blade root DELs, the overall prediction error is less than 1%. The proposed scheme promotes utilization of sparse structural monitoring (loads) measurements for improving diagnostics on wake-affected turbines. ISSN:0960-1481","id":"10.1016/j.renene.2021.02.003"}

{"text":"As part of the development of a European Seismic Risk Model 2020 (ESRM20), the spatial and temporal evolution of seismic design across Europe has been studied in order to bet- ter classify reinforced concrete buildings (which represent more than 30% of the approxi- mately 145 million residential, commercial and industrial buildings in Europe) and map them to vulnerability models based on simulated seismic design. This paper summarises the model that has been developed to assign the years when different seismic design levels (low code, moderate code and high code) were introduced in a number of European coun- tries and the associated lateral forces that were specified spatially within each country for the low and moderate codes for typical reinforced concrete mid-rise buildings. This process has led to an improved understanding of how design regulations evolved across Europe and how this has impacted the vulnerability of the European residential building stock. The model estimates that ~ 60% of the reinforced concrete buildings in Europe have been seis- mically designed, and of those buildings ~ 60% have been designed to low code, ~ 25% to moderate code and 15% to high code. This seismic design model aims at being a dynamic source of information that will be continuously updated with additional feedback from local experts and datasets. To this end, all of the data has been made openly available as shapefiles on a GitLab repository.","id":"10.1007/s10518-021-01083-3"}

{"text":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the stable boundary layer, thermal submesofronts (TSFs) are detected during the Shallow Cold Pool experiment in the Colorado plains, Colorado, USA in 2012. The topography induces TSFs by forming two different air layers converging on the valley-side wall while being stacked vertically above the valley bottom. The warm-air layer is mechanically generated by lee turbulence that consistently elevates near-surface temperatures, while the cold-air layer is thermodynamically driven by radiative cooling and the corresponding cold-air drainage decreases near-surface temperatures. The semi-stationary TSFs can only be detected, tracked, and investigated in detail when using fibre-optic distributed sensing (FODS), as point observations miss TSFs most of the time. Neither the occurrence of TSFs nor the characteristics of each air layer are connected to a specific wind or thermal regime. However, each air layer is characterized by a specific relationship between the wind speed and the friction velocity. Accordingly, a single threshold separating different flow regimes within the boundary layer is an oversimplification, especially during the occurrence of TSFs. No local forcings or their combination could predict the occurrence of TSFs except that they are less likely to occur during stronger near-surface or synoptic-scale flow. While classical conceptualizations and techniques of the boundary layer fail in describing the formation of TSFs, the use of spatially continuous data obtained from FODS provide new insights. Future studies need to incorporate spatially continuous data in the horizontal and vertical planes, in addition to classic sensor networks of sonic anemometry and thermohygrometers to fully characterize and describe boundary-layer phenomena. </jats:p>","id":"10.1007/s10546-021-00619-z"}

{"text":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Strategic Environmental Assessment (SEA), as a support to strategic planning, is a starting point in the creation of a sustainable concept of managing waste that is based on the principles of a circular economy. The role of SEA is to guide the planning process towards the goal of securing the best effects in relation to the quality of the living environment and the socio-economic aspects of development. SEA is also an instrument that can be used when making optimal decisions about spatial development, which further contributes to its importance and role in the planning process. The implementation of SEA allows developers to establish the benefits and implications of the proposed spatial changes, taking into account the capacity of the space to sustain the planned development, and to determine the degree of acceptability of the proposed spatial changes. This paper presents a specific method used for impact assessment in SEA for the Agro-Waste Management Plan (AWMP) for Oplenac Vineyard. The specificity of this method is that it combines specific goals, indicators and criteria for assessing the effect of planning solutions formulated in the simulated AWMP for Oplenac Vineyard using a semi-quantitative expert method. The results of the paper indicate the possibility of using GIS tools to increase objectivity in the expert evaluation of planning solutions, particularly in relation to a group of criteria for assessing the spatial dispersion of the impacts. This reduces the subjectivity that is characteristic of all expert methods. The graphical presentation of the results in GIS technology and the use of matrices and graphs to present the results makes them easier to understand and creates a good basis for making optimal decisions on future activities concerning the elimination of waste from wineries and viticulture.

{"text":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Microplastics (plastics &lt;5\u00a0mm, including nanoplastics which are &lt;0.1\u00a0\u03bcm) originate from the fragmentation of large plastic litter or from direct environmental emission. Their potential impacts in terrestrial ecosystems remain largely unexplored despite numerous reported effects on marine organisms. Most plastics arriving in the oceans were produced, used, and often disposed on land. Hence, it is within terrestrial systems that microplastics might first interact with biota eliciting ecologically relevant impacts. This article introduces the pervasive microplastic contamination as a potential agent of global change in terrestrial systems, highlights the physical and chemical nature of the respective observed effects, and discusses the broad toxicity of nanoplastics derived from plastic breakdown. Making relevant links to the fate of microplastics in aquatic continental systems, we here present new insights into the mechanisms of impacts on terrestrial geochemistry, the biophysical environment, and ecotoxicology. Broad changes in continental environments are possible even in particle\u2010rich habitats such as soils. Furthermore, there is a growing body of evidence indicating that microplastics interact with terrestrial organisms that mediate essential ecosystem services and functions, such as soil dwelling invertebrates, terrestrial fungi, and plant\u2010pollinators. Therefore, research is needed to clarify the terrestrial fate and effects of microplastics. We suggest that due to the widespread presence, environmental persistence, and various interactions with continental biota, microplastic pollution might represent an emerging global change threat to terrestrial ecosystems.</jats:p>","id":"10.1111/gcb.14020"}

{"text":"Abstract ud Aims Rhizodeposits collected from hydroponic solutions with roots of maize and barley, and seed mucilage washed from chia, were added to soil to measure their impact on water retention and hysteresis in a sandy loam soil at a range of concentrations. We test the hypothesis that the effect of plant exudates and mucilages on hydraulic properties of soils depend on their physicochemical characteristics and origin. ud Methods Surface tension and viscosity of the exudate solutions were measured using the Du No\u00fcy ring method and a cone-plate rheometer, respectively. The contact angle of water on exudate treated soil was measured with the sessile drop method. Water retention and hysteresis were measured by equilibrating soil samples, treated with exudates and mucilages at 0.46 and 4.6 mg g\u22121 concentration, on dialysis tubing filled with polyethylene glycol (PEG) solution of known osmotic potential. ud Results Surface tension decreased and viscosity increased with increasing concentration of the exudates and mucilage in solutions. Change in surface tension and viscosity was greatest for chia seed exudate and least for barley root exudate. Contact angle increased with increasing maize root and chia seed exudate concentration in soil, but not barley root. Chia seed mucilage and maize root rhizodeposits enhanced soil water retention and increased hysteresis index, whereas barley root rhizodeposits decreased soil water retention and the hysteresis effect. The impact of exudates and mucilages on soil water retention almost ceased when approaching the wilting point at \u22121500 kPa matric potential. ud Conclusions Barley rhizodeposits behaved as surfactants, drying the rhizosphere at smaller suctions. Chia seed mucilage and maize root rhizodeposits behaved as hydrogels that hold more water in the rhizosphere, but with slower rewetting and greater hysteresis.","id":"10.1007/s11104-019-03939-9"}

{"text":"Background  Changes in the diversity of herbivore communities can strongly influence the functioning of northern ecosystems. Different herbivores have different impacts on ecosystems because of differences in their diets, behaviour and energy requirements. The combined effects of different herbivores can in some cases compensate each other but lead to stronger directional changes elsewhere. However, the diversity of herbivore assemblages has until recently been a largely overlooked dimension of plant\u2013herbivore interactions. Given the ongoing environmental changes in tundra ecosystems, with increased influx of boreal species and changes in the distribution and abundance of arctic herbivores, a better understanding of the consequences of changes in the diversity of herbivore assemblages is needed. This protocol presents the methodology that will be used in a systematic review on the effects of herbivore diversity on different processes, functions and properties of tundra ecosystems. Methods  This systematic review builds on an earlier systematic map on herbivory studies in the Arctic that identified a relatively large number of studies assessing the effects of multiple herbivores. The systematic review will include primary field studies retrieved from databases, search engines and specialist websites, that compare responses of tundra ecosystems to different levels of herbivore diversity, including both vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. We will use species richness of herbivores or the richness of functional groups of herbivores as a measure of the diversity of the herbivore assemblages. Studies will be screened in three stages: title, abstract and full text, and inclusion will follow clearly identified eligibility criteria, based on their target population, exposure, comparator and study design. The review will cover terrestrial Arctic ecosystems including the forest-tundra ecotone. Potential outcomes will include multiple processes, functions and properties of tundra ecosystems related to primary productivity, nutrient cycling, accumulation and dynamics of nutrient pools, as well as the impacts of herbivores on other organisms. Studies will be critically appraised for validity, and where studies report similar outcomes, meta-analysis will be performed. Background  Herbivores in tundra ecosystems include organisms varying in size, from large ungulates, like muskoxen or reindeer, to small rodents, birds and invertebrates [1]. Arctic herbivores also vary in other traits that influence how they interact with plants and their environment, such as migratory behaviour, home range size, or their digestive physiology [2]. Given these differences, the diet choices and energy requirements of herbivores differ strongly [3, 4] and so do their impacts on ecosystems. Further, the effects of herbivores on processes, functions and properties of tundra ecosystems can be direct or indirect. For example, trampling by large herbivores can influence soil structure and soil biota directly, but also indirectly through changes in plant abundance and community composition [5]. To add to this complexity, the combined effects of different herbivore assemblages can lead to opposite outcomes (Fig. 1a). For example, in some cases the combined effects of large and small mammalian herbivores on vegetation are stronger than would be predicted for each group of herbivores alone [6,7,8]. In other cases, the effects of different herbivores can compensate each other if herbivores consume different plant species, leading to little to no changes in plant community composition [3, 9]. However, herbivore diversity has until recently been a largely overlooked dimension of plant\u2013herbivore interactions in tundra ecosystems [10, 11], and we know little about how functionally different herbivore assemblages will affect these systems.","id":"10.1186/s13750-022-00257-z"}

{"text":"Open AccessMaterials that are both biodegradable and bio-sourced are becoming serious candidates for substituting traditional petro-sourced plastics that accumulate in natural systems. New biocomposites have been produced by melt extrusion, using bacterial polyester (poly(3-hydroxybutyrate-co-3-hydroxyvalerate)) as a matrix and cellulose particles as fillers. In this study, gas-phase esterified cellulose particles, with palmitoyl chloride, were used to improve filler-matrix compatibility and reduce moisture sensitivity. Structural analysis demonstrated that intrinsic properties of the polymer matrix (crystallinity, and molecular weight) were not more significantly affected by the incorporation of cellulose, either virgin or grafted. Only a little decrease in matrix thermal stability was noticed, this being limited by cellulose grafting. Gas-phase esterification of cellulose improved the filler\u2019s dispersion state and filler/matrix interfacial adhesion, as shown by SEM cross-section observations, and limiting the degradation of tensile properties (stress and strain at break). Water vapor permeability, moisture, and liquid water uptake of biocomposites were increased compared to the neat matrix. The increase in thermodynamic parameters was limited in the case of grafted cellulose, principally ascribed to their increased hydrophobicity. However, no significant effect of grafting was noticed regarding diffusion parameters. International audience","id":"10.3390/polym11020200"}

Knowledge of <jats:styled-content style='fixed-case'>iWUE</jats:styled-content> is commonly gained from leaf\u2010level gas exchange measurements, which are inevitably restricted in their spatial and temporal coverage. Flux measurements based on the eddy covariance (<jats:styled-content style='fixed-case'>EC</jats:styled-content>) technique can overcome these limitations, as they provide continuous and long\u2010term records of carbon and water fluxes at the ecosystem scale. However, vegetation gas exchange parameters derived from <jats:styled-content style='fixed-case'>EC</jats:styled-content> data are subject to scale\u2010dependent and method\u2010specific uncertainties that compromise their ecophysiological interpretation as well as their comparability among ecosystems and across spatial scales. Here, we use estimates of canopy conductance and gross primary productivity (<jats:styled-content style='fixed-case'>GPP</jats:styled-content>) derived from <jats:styled-content style='fixed-case'>EC</jats:styled-content> data to calculate a measure of <jats:styled-content style='fixed-case'>iWUE</jats:styled-content> (<jats:italic>G</jats:italic><jats:sub>1</jats:sub>, \u201cstomatal slope\u201d) at the ecosystem level at six sites comprising tropical, Mediterranean, temperate, and boreal forests.

Our results demonstrate that an unclosed energy balance caused the largest uncertainties, in particular if it was associated with erroneous latent heat flux estimates.

{"text":"Abstract   This study investigated the impact of bench-scale ozonation on the inactivation of total cultivable and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (faecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Enterococcus spp., and total heterotrophs), and the reduction of gene markers (16S rRNA and intl1) and antibiotic resistance genes (qacE\u03941, sul1, aadA1 and dfrA1) indigenously present in wastewater effluents treated by membrane bioreactor (MBR) or conventional activated sludge (CAS). The Chick-Watson model-predicted ozone exposure (CT) requirements, showed that higher CT values were needed for CAS- than MBR-treated effluents to achieve a 3-log reduction of each microbial group, i.e., ~30 and 10 gO3 min gDOC\u22121 respectively. Ozonation was efficient in inactivating the examined antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and no bacterial regrowth was observed after 72\u00a0h. The genes abundance decreased significantly by ozone, but an increase in their abundance was detected 72\u00a0h after storage of the treated samples. A very low removal of DOC was achieved and at the same time phyto- and eco-toxicity increased after the ozonation treatment in both wastewater matrices. The gene abundance, regrowth and toxicity results of this study may be of high environmental significance for comprehensive evaluation of ozone and may guide future studies in assessing these parameters for other oxidants/disinfectants.","id":"10.1016/j.jhazmat.2021.126527"}

{"text":"Open AccessElevated atmospheric CO2 concentration (eCa) might reduce forest water-use, due to decreased transpiration, following partial stomatal closure, thus enhancing water-use efficiency and productivity at low water availability. If evapotranspiration (Et) is reduced, it may subsequently increase soil water storage ( S) or surface runoff (R) and drainage (Dg), although these could be offset or even reversed by changes in vegetation structure, mainly increased leaf area index (L). To understand the effect of eCa in a water-limited ecosystem, we tested whether 2\u00a0years of eCa (~40% increase) affected the hydrological partitioning in a mature water-limited Eucalyptus woodland exposed to Free-Air CO2 Enrichment (FACE). This timeframe allowed us to evaluate whether physiological effects of eCa reduced stand water-use irrespective of L, which was unaffected by eCa in this timeframe. We hypothesized that eCa would reduce tree-canopy transpiration (Etree), but excess water from reduced Etree would be lost via increased soil evaporation and understory transpiration (Efloor) with no increase in S, R or Dg. We computed Et, S, R and Dg from measurements of sapflow velocity, L, soil water content (?), understory micrometeorology, throughfall and stemflow. We found that eCa did not affect Etree, Efloor, S or ? at any depth (to 4.5\u00a0m) over the experimental period. We closed the water balance for dry seasons with no differences in the partitioning to R and Dg between Ca levels. Soil temperature and ? were the main drivers of Efloor while vapour pressure deficit-controlled Etree, though eCa did not significantly affect any of these relationships. Our results suggest that in the short-term, eCa does not significantly affect ecosystem water-use at this site. We conclude that water-savings under eCa mediated by either direct effects on plant transpiration or by indirect effects via changes in L or soil moisture availability are unlikely in water-limited mature eucalypt woodlands.

{"text":"Spatially detailed information on agricultural nitrogen (N) budgets is relevant to identify regions where there is a need for a reduction in inputs in view of various forms of N pollution. However, at the scale of the European Union, there is a lack of consistent, reliable, high spatial resolution data necessary for the calculation of regional N losses. To gain insight in the reduction in uncertainty achieved by using higher spatial resolution input data. This was done by comparing spatially disaggregated agricultural N budgets for Denmark for the period 2000\u20132010, generated by two versions of the European scale model Integrator, a version using high spatial resolution national data for Denmark (Integrator-DK) and a version using available data at the EU scale (Integrator-EU). Results showed that the national N fluxes in the N budgets calculated by the two versions of the model were within 1\u20135% for N inputs by fertilizer and manure excretion, but inputs by N fixation and N mineralisation differed by 50\u2013100% and N uptake also differed by ca 25%, causing a difference in N leaching and runoff of nearly 50%. Comparison with an independently derived Danish national budget appeared generally to be better with Integrator-EU results in 2000 but with Integrator-DK results in 2010. However, the spatial distribution of manure distribution and N losses from Integrator-DK were closer to observed distributions than those from Integrator-EU. We conclude that close attention to local agronomic practices is needed when using a leaching fraction approach and that for effective support of environmental policymaking, Member States need to collect or submit high spatial resolution agricultural data to Eurostat.","id":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.06.267"}

NitroPortugal is a co-financer for the project Towards INMS, implemented by UN Environment. Concentration of pollutants in precipitation available in the EBAS database has largely been funded by the UN-ECE CLRTAP (EMEP) and through NILU internal resources. To protect human health and the environment (namely ecosystems), international air quality protocols and guidelines, like the Gothenburg protocol (1999) and the 2001 EU Air Quality Directive (NECD), conveyed national emission ceilings for atmospheric pollutants (Directive 2001/81/EC), including the reduction of sulfur (S) and nitrogen (N) emissions by 2010. However, to what degree this expected reduction in emissions had reflections at the ecosystem level (i.e. pollutant levels reaching and impacting ecosystems and their organisms) remains unknown. Here, we used lichens as ecological indicators, together with reported air and precipitation pollutant concentrations, to determine and map the consequences of the S and N atmospheric emission's reduction, during the implementation of the 2001 Directive (in 2002 and 2011), due primarily to the industrial-sector. The study area is a mixed-land-use industrialized Mediterranean agroforest ecosystem, in southwest Europe. The reduction of S emissions (2002-2011) was reflected at the ecosystem level, as the same S-declining trend was observed in atmospheric measurement stations and lichens alike (-70%), indicating that most S deposited to the ecosystem had an industrial origin. However, this was not the case for N with a slight N-reduction near industrial facilities, but mostly N-deposition in lichens increased in areas dominated by agricultural land-uses. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of going beyond emissions estimation and modeling, to assess the success of the implementation of the NECD in lowering pollutant accumulation in living organisms and their environment. This can only be achieved by measuring pollutant deposition at the ecosystem level (e.g. living organisms). By doing so, we were able to show that the 2001 NECD was successful in reducing S concentrations from Industry, whereas N remains a challenge. Despite the small reduction in N-emissions, deposition into ecosystems did not reflect these changes as agriculture and transport sectors must reduce NH3 and NOx emissions.

{"text":"When manufactured nanoparticles are released to natural waters, heteroaggregation between nanoparticles and water compounds is expected to occur and play a key role in nanoparticle fate, transport and transformation. In this work, the heteroaggregation between CeO2 nanoparticles and Fe2O3 inorganic colloids, which represent the main inorganic fraction from Lake Geneva water, is studied. The heteroaggregation processes between CeO2, Fe2O3 and alginate in multiple water samples are investigated using zeta potential and z-average diameter measurements. The kinetics of heteroaggregation of individual components as well as mixtures of CeO2 nanoparticles and Fe2O3 colloids and alginate are studied using time resolved dynamic light scattering. The global attachment efficiency (\u03b1global) is calculated using data from kinetic experiments. \u03b1global for pristine CeO2 nanoparticles varied from 0.5 to 0.7 in lake and synthetic waters and is found around 1 for pristine Fe2O3 and mixture CeO2 and Fe2O3. Our findings demonstrate that heteroaggregation is highly dependent on environmental conditions and resulting electrostatic scenarios. No heteroaggregation at pH 8 between CeO2, Fe2O3 and alginate is observed in ultrapure water, because of electrostatic repulsions between negatively charged compounds. In synthetic and lake waters, the situation is opposite. Indeed, specific adsorption of divalent cations and presence of salt are found to promote heteroaggregation via cation bridging and screening effects. The kinetic experiments indicate that aggregation rate of pristine Fe2O3 is higher (89 nm/min in lake water) compared to pristine CeO2 nanoparticles (50 nm/min) and on the same level as mixture of CeO2 and Fe2O3 (96 nm/min). Low alginate concentration, 0.25 mg/L, has no effect on heteroaggregation in mixture of CeO2 and Fe2O3 in lake and synthetic waters. On the other hand, in natural water, the presence of higher alginate concentration, 2 mg/L, is found to reduce the heteroaggregation rate.","id":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.08.176"}

Once released in aquatic systems, NPs will interact with natural compounds such as suspended inorganic particles and/or natural organic matter (NOM) and heteroaggregation will control their ultimate fate. Unfortunately, systematic experimental methods to study heteroaggregation are not straightforward and still scarce. In addition, the description of heteroaggregation rate constants and attachment efficiencies is still a matter of debate since no clear definition exists.  In this work, an original cluster-cluster Monte Carlo model is developed to get an insight into heteroaggregation process descriptions. A two-component system composed of NPs and NOM fulvic acid monomers is investigated by considering several water models to cover a range of (relevant) conditions from fresh to marine waters. For that purpose, homo- and hetero- individual attachment efficiencies between NPs and NOM units are adjusted (NP-NP, NOM-NOM and NP-NOM). The influence of NP/NOM ratio, NOM-NOM homoaggregation versus heteroaggregation, and surface coating effects is studied systematically. From a quantitative point of view, aggregation rate constants as well as attachment efficiencies are calculated as a function of physical time so as to characterize the individual influence of each parameter and to allow future comparison with experimental data. Heteroaggregation processes and global attachment efficiencies corresponding to several mechanisms and depending on the evolution of heteroaggregate structures all along the simulations are defined. The calculation of attachment efficiency values is found dependent on NP/NOM concentration ratios via coating effects, by the initial set of elementary attachment efficiencies and influence of homoaggregation.  Marine water represents a specific case of aggregation where all particle contacts are effective. On the other hand, in \u201cultrapure\u201d and \u201cfresh waters\u201d, a competition between homo- and heteroaggregation occurs depending on the initial attachment efficiencies therefore indicating that a subtle change in the NP surface properties as well as in the water chemistry have a significant impact on heteroaggregation processes.","id":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.09.017"}

{"text":"The evaluation of the level of alkaloids in edible Lupinus species is crucial from a food safety point of view. Debittering of lupin seeds has a long history; however, the control of the level of alkaloids after processing the seeds is typically only evaluated by changes in the bitter taste. The aim of this study was to evaluate the profile and residual levels of quinolizidine alkaloids (QA) in (Lupinus mutabilis Sweet) after aqueous debittering process. Samples from 10 ecotypes from different areas of Peru were analyzed before and after the process. Based on results obtained by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry, from eight alkaloids identified before the debittering process, only small amounts of lupanine (avg. 0.0012\u00a0g/100\u00a0g DM) and sparteine (avg. 0.0014\u00a0g/100\u00a0g DM) remained in the seeds after the debittering process, and no other alkaloids were identified. The aqueous debittering process reduced the content of alkaloids to levels far below the maximal level allowed by international regulations (\u2264 0.2\u00a0g/kg DM).

{"text":"Compound-specific stable isotope (CSSI) fingerprinting of sediment sources is a recently introduced tool to overcome some limitations of conventional approaches for sediment source apportionment. The technique uses the 13C CSSI signature of plant-derived fatty acids (\u03b413C-fatty acids) associated with soil minerals as a tracer. This paper provides methodological perspectives to advance the use of CSSI fingerprinting in combination with stable isotope mixing models (SIMMs) to apportion the relative contributions of different sediment sources (i.e. land uses) to sediments. CSSI fingerprinting allows quantitative estimation of the relative contribution of sediment sources within a catchment at a spatio-temporal resolution, taking into account the following approaches. First, application of CSSI fingerprinting techniques to complex catchments presents particular challenges and calls for well-designed sampling strategies and data handling. Hereby, it is essential to balance the effort required for representative sample collection and analyses against the need to accurately quantify the variability within the system. Second, robustness of the CSSI approach depends on the specificity and conservativeness of the \u03b413C-FA fingerprint. Therefore, saturated long-chain (>20 carbon atoms) FAs, which are biosynthesised exclusively by higher plants and are more stable than the more commonly used short-chain FAs, should be used. Third, given that FA concentrations can vary largely between sources, concentration-dependent SIMMs that are also able to incorporate \u03b413C-FA variability should be standard operation procedures to correctly assess the contribution of sediment sources via SIMMs. This paper reflects on the use of \u03b413C-FAs in erosion studies and provides recommendations for its application. We strongly advise the use of saturated long-chain (>20 carbon atoms) FAs as tracers and concentration-dependent Bayesian SIMMs. We anticipate progress in CSSI sediment fingerprinting from two current developments: (i) development of hierarchical Bayesian SIMMs to better address catchment complexity and (ii) incorporation of dual isotope approaches (\u03b4                            13C- and \u03b4                            2H-FA) to improve estimates of sediment sources.","id":"10.1007/s11368-017-1706-4"}

C and nitrogen (N) mineralization rates (C: 0.48, N: 0.48) along with nutrient leaching (C: 0.30, N: 0.77) increased, with a stronger response to outbreak relative to background insect densities. The negative responses increased in strength in colder and dryer biomes while positive responses were reinforced in warmer and wetter biomes, thus extending previously shown effects for vertebrate herbivores to also include insect herbivory. The positive response by soil fauna to insect herbivory was the notable exception. This may be associated with the limited physical soil disturbance caused by insects compared to ungulates. Furthermore, we identified an under\u2010representation in the literature of large areas of boreal and tropical biomes calling for research priorities to fill these knowledge gaps.

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience Purpose: Identifying best practices for sediment fingerprinting or tracing is important to allow the quantification of sediment contributions from catchment sources. Although sediment fingerprinting has been applied with reasonable success, the deployment of this method remains associated with many issues and limitations.Methods: Seminars and debates were organised during a four-day Thematic School in October 2021 to come up with concrete suggestions to improve the design and implementation of tracing methods.Results: First, we suggest a better use of geomorphological information to improve study design. Researchers are invited to scrutinize all the knowledge available on the catchment of interest, and to obtain multiple lines of evidence regarding sediment source contributions. Second, we think that scientific knowledge could be improved with local knowledge and we propose a scale of participation describing different levels of involvement of locals in research. Third, we recommend the use of stateof-the-art sediment tracing protocols to conduct sampling, deal with particle size, examine data before modelling and accounting for the hydro-meteorological context under investigation. Fourth, we promote best practices in modelling, including the importance of running multiple models, selecting appropriate tracers, and reporting on model errors and uncertainty. Fifth, we suggest best practices to share tracing data and samples, which will increase the visibility of the fingerprinting technique in geoscience. Sixth, we suggest that a better formulation of hypotheses could improve our knowledge about erosion and sediment transport processes in a more unified way. Conclusion: With the suggested improvements, sediment fingerprinting, which is interdisciplinary in nature, could play a major role to meet the current and future challenges associated with global change.","id":"10.1007/s11368-022-03203-1"}

Plant water deficit index (PWDI) represents the extent of water stress by relating soil moisture to the ability of a plant to take up water including consideration of the relative distribution of soil water to roots. However, for a smart irrigation decision support system, we are challenged in determining reliable thresholds of PWDI to initiate irrigation events to achieve predetermined yield and/or water use efficiency (WUE) targets. Taking drip irrigated maize and sprinkler irrigated alfalfa as examples, field experiments were conducted to investigate the choice and effects of PWDI thresholds. The results indicated that, with increasing PWDI thresholds, irrigation times and quantity of water, as well as crop transpiration, growth, and yield, were all significantly limited while WUE was enhanced except under extremely stressed conditions. To disconnect the unpredictable effects of other factors, yield and WUE were normalized to their corresponding potential values. Within the experimentally determined range of PWDI, relative yield and WUE were described with linear functions for maize, and linear and quadratic functions for alfalfa, allowing identification of the most efficient threshold value according to the objective parameter of choice. The method described can be adopted in smart irrigation decision support systems with consideration of spatial variability and after further verification and improvement under more complicated situations with various crop types and varieties, environmental conditions, cultivation modes, and wider or dynamic PWDI thresholds allowing regulated deficit irrigation.

Conventional infrared imaging technologies, however, require the use of materials like narrow-band gap semiconductors which are sensitive to thermal noise and often require cryogenic cooling. Here, we demonstrate a compact all-optical alternative to perform infrared imaging in a metasurface composed of GaAs semiconductor nanoantennas, using a nonlinear wave-mixing process. We experimentally show the up-conversion of short-wave infrared wavelengths via the coherent parametric process of sum-frequency generation. In this process, an infrared image of a target is mixed inside the metasurface with a strong pump beam, translating the image from infrared to the visible in a nanoscale ultra-thin imaging device. Our results open up new opportunities for the development of compact infrared imaging devices with applications in infrared vision and life sciences.

{"text":"Soil water-stable aggregate (WSA) stability is one of the most important indicators of soil health, because it influences chemical, biological and other physical properties. At the same time, WSA formation, stabilization and degradation are also some of the most complex processes that occur in the soil, making them difficult to fully understand. In particular, there is a lack of research on WSA stability in the Baltic region. To gain a better understanding how aggregation occurs in Estonian pedo-climatic conditions, this study was conducted in 2014\u2013 2015 in a sandy loam Stagnic Luvisol (LV-st) (WRB, 2014). Potato and barley plots were analysed in a three-year crop rotation (potato \u2192 spring wheat \u2192 barley) with straw removal. The nitrogen (N) fertilization treatments were 0, 40, 80, 120 and 160 kg ha-1 yr-1 N, both without and with 40 Mg ha-1 fermented cattle farmyard manure (FYM) application prior to potato planting in the previous autumn. WSA stability was determined by Eijkelkamp\u2019s wet sieving apparatus from air-dried soil samples of less than 2 mm in diameter. The study revealed a negative correlation (r = \u22120.16) between increased N rates and WSA stability, regardless of FYM applications. Although soil organic carbon (SOC) content increased with additional N fertilization rates, the reduction in soil acidity (pHKCl) levels caused by N fertilization, most likely repealed the positive SOC content effect on WSA stability. In general, compared with sole N fertilization, FYM application had a positive effect on WSA stability. However, even though WSA stability did not always increase with FYM applications, it still had a positive effect on bulk density, SOC content and soil acidity levels. Further research is needed in Estonia due to the complexities involved in the soil aggregation process. This study was supported by the H2020 project iSQAPER-635750.","id":"10.13080/z-a.2018.105.025"}

This study was also funded by the project \u2018Low Input Sustainable Agriculture (LISA)\u2019 under the Operational program FEDER for Catalonia 2014\u20102020 RIS3CAT (http://www.lisaproject.cat/introduction/). Irrigation scheduling decision-support tools can improve water use efficiency by matching irrigation recommendations to prevailing soil and crop conditions within a season. Yet, little research is available on how to support real-time precision irrigation that varies within-season in both time and space. We investigate the integration of remotely sensed NDVI time-series, soil moisture sensor measurements, and root zone simulation forecasts for in-season delineation of dynamic management zones (MZ) and for a variable rate irrigation scheduling in order to improve irrigation scheduling and crop performance. Delineation of MZ was conducted in a 5.8-ha maize field during 2018 using Sentinel-2 NDVI time-series and an unsupervised classification. The number and spatial extent of MZs changed through the growing season. A network of soil moisture sensors was used to interpret spatiotemporal changes of the NDVI. Soil water content was a significant contributor to changes in crop vigor across MZs through the growing season. Real-time cluster validity function analysis provided in-season evaluation of the MZ design. For example, the total within-MZ daily soil moisture relative variance decreased from 85% (early vegetative stages) to below 25% (late reproductive stages). Finally, using the Hydrus-1D model, a workflow for in-season optimization of irrigation scheduling and water delivery management was tested. Data simulations indicated that crop transpiration could be optimized while reducing water applications between 11 and 28.5% across the dynamic MZs. The proposed integration of spatiotemporal crop and soil moisture data can be used to support management decisions to effectively control outputs of crop \u00d7 environment \u00d7 management interactions.

{"text":"Open AccessFunding from the European Commission under project SHui \u2013 Grant agreement ID 773903. Considerable spatial variability in soil hydraulic properties exists within a field, even in those considered homogeneous. Spatial variability of water as a major driver of crop heterogeneity gains particular relevance within the context of precision agriculture, but modelling has devoted insufficient efforts to scale up from point to field the associated \u2018cause-effect\u2019 relations of water spatial variations. Seven crop simulation models (WOFOST, DSSAT, APSIM, DAISY, STICS, AquaCrop and MONICA) and five hydrologic models (HYDRUS-1D, HYDRUS-2D, SWAP, MIKE-SHE and SWIM) were selected and their water modelling approaches were systematically reviewed for comparison. Crop models rely mainly on \u2018discrete\u2019 and empirical approaches for modelling soil water movement while hydrologic models emphasize more \u2018continuous\u2019 and mechanistic ones. Combining both types of models may not be the best way forward as none of the models consider all of the processes which are relevant for the simulation of spatial variations. Hydrologic models pay more attention to spatially variable water processes than crop simulation models, although their focus is on scales higher than the field which is the relevant scale for assessing the influence of such variations on crop behaviour. Opportunities for progress in the spatial simulation of water processes at field level will probably come from two different directions. One implying a stronger synergism between both model families by using continuous-type approaches to simulate some mechanisms in existing crop models, and the other through the integration of lateral flows in the simulation of discrete water movement approaches.","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106254"}

{"text":"Insect herbivory is known to augment emissions of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs). Yet few studies have quantified BVOC responses to insect herbivory in natural populations in pan-Arctic regions. Here, we assess how quantitative and qualitative BVOC emissions change with increasing herbivore feeding intensity in the Subarctic mountain birch (Betula pubescens var pumila (L.)) forest. We conducted three field experiments in which we manipulated the larval density of geometrid moths (Operophtera brumata and Epirrita autumnata), on branches of mountain birch and measured BVOC emissions using the branch enclosure method and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Our study showed that herbivory significantly increased BVOC emissions from the branches damaged by larvae. BVOC emissions increased due to insect herbivory at relatively low larvae densities, causing up to 10% of leaf area loss. Insect herbivory also changed the blend composition of BVOCs, with damaged plants producing less intercorrelated BVOC blends than undamaged ones. Our results provide a quantitative understanding of the relationship between the severity of insect herbivore damage and emissions of BVOCs at larvae densities corresponding to background herbivory levels in the Subarctic mountain birch. The results have important and practical implications for modeling induced and constitutive BVOC emissions and their feedbacks to atmospheric chemistry. arctic, biotic stress, geometrid moth, insect herbivory, mountain birch, stress severity, volatile organic compounds","id":"10.3389/fpls.2020.558979"}

{"text":"Open AccessThe decomposition of fresh crop residues added to soil for agricultural purposes is complex. This is due to different factors that influence the decomposition process. In field conditions, the incorporation of crop residues into soil does not always have a positive effect on aggregate stability. The aim of this study was to investigate the decomposition effects of residues from two different cover crops (Brassica napus var. oleifera and Secale cereale) and one main crop (wheat straw) on soil aggregate stability. A 105-day incubation experiment was conducted in which crop residues were mixed with sandy loam soil at a rate of 6 g C kg&minus 1 of soil. During the incubation, there were five water additions. The decomposition effects of organic matter on soil conditions during incubation were evaluated by determining the soil functional groups carbon dioxide (CO2), nitrous oxide (N2O), and methane (CH4) emissions soil microbial biomass carbon (MBC) and water-stable aggregates (WSA). The functional groups of the plant residues and the soil were analyzed using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) and a double exponential model was used to estimate the decomposition rates. The results show that the decomposition rate of fresh organic materials was correlated with the soil functional groups and the C/N ratio. Oilseed rape and rye, with lower C/N ratios than wheat straw residues, had faster decomposition rates and higher CO2 and N2O emissions than wheat straw. The CO2 and N2O flush at the start of the experiment corresponded to a decrease of soil aggregate stability (from Day 3 to Day 10 for CO2 and from Day 19 to Day 28 for N2O emissions), which was linked to higher decomposition rates of the labile fraction. The lower decomposition rates contributed to higher remaining C (carbon) and higher soil aggregate stability. The results also show that changes in the soil functional groups due to crop residue incorporation did not significantly influence aggregate stability. Soil moisture (SM) negatively influenced the aggregate stability and greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) in all treatments (oilseed rape, rye, wheat straw, and control). Irrespective of the water addition procedure, rye and wheat straw residues had a positive effect on water-stable aggregates more frequently than oilseed rape during the incubation period. The results presented here may contribute to a better understanding of decomposition processes after the incorporation of fresh crop residues from cover crops. A future field study investigating the influence of incorporation rates of different crop residues on soil aggregate stability would be of great interest.","id":"10.3390/agriculture10110527"}

{"text":"Spring frost poses a challenge for all major crops and, in the case of <i>Lupinus mutabilis</i> (Andean lupin) can cause severe damage or even total loss of the crop. Within the LIBBIO project consortium, we conducted a series of experiments in order to develop a suitable protocol for screening lupin germplasm under frost-simulation conditions. Four lupin accessions, one <i>Lupinus albus</i> and three Andean lupins were used in the experiments (<i>L. albus</i> Mihai, <i>L. mutabilis</i> LIB 220, LIB 221, LIB 222). Seedlings at four developmental stages were challenged with five different levels of \u2018frost\u2019 stress from low (\u22122 \u00b0C) to high (\u221210 \u00b0C). Notably, young seedling (cotyledons just breaking through the soil surface) showed little evidence of frost damage for temperatures down to \u22126 \u00b0C. At \u22128 \u00b0C, however, damage was evident, suggesting a cold tolerance threshold occurs at this temperature. Interestingly, for later developmental stages, when the first and second leaves were visible, notable differences were observed starting at \u22126 \u00b0C. The results indicate that the plant growth stage is an important parameter when screening for frost tolerance in germplasm. Overall, by identifying Andean lupin genotypes adapted to high abiotic stress factors, farmers will be able to use it as a reference crop with potentially a commercial interest from the food sector, or cosmetics, and biofuel industries.","id":"10.3390/agriculture11020155"}

{"text":"Open AccessIn viticulture, detailed spatial information about actual evapotranspiration (ETa) and vine water status within a vineyard may be of particular utility when applying site-specific, precision irrigation management. Over recent decades, extensive research has been carried out in the use of remote sensing energy balance models to estimate and monitor ETa at the field level. However, one of the major limitations remains the coarse spatial resolution in the thermal infrared (TIR) domain. In this context, the recent advent of the Sentinel missions of the European Space Agency (ESA) has greatly improved the possibility of monitoring crop parameters and estimating ETa at higher temporal and spatial resolutions. In order to bridge the gap between the coarse-resolution Sentinel-3 thermal and the fine-resolution Sentinel-2 shortwave data, sharpening techniques have been used to downscale the Sentinel-3 land surface temperature (LST) from 1 km to 20 m. However, the accurate estimates of high-resolution LST through sharpening techniques are still unclear, particularly when intended to be used for detecting crop water stress. The goal of this study was to assess the feasibility of the two-source energy balance model (TSEB) using sharpened LST images from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-3 (TSEB-PTS2+3) to estimate the spatio-temporal variability of actual transpiration (T) and water stress in a vineyard. T and crop water stress index (CWSI) estimates were evaluated against a vine water consumption model and regressed with in situ stem water potential (\u03a8stem). Two different TSEB approaches, using very high-resolution airborne thermal imagery, were also included in the analysis as benchmarks for TSEB-PTS2+3. One of them uses aggregated TIR data at the vine+inter-row level (TSEB-PTairb), while the other is based on a contextual method that directly, although separately, retrieves soil and canopy temperatures (TSEB-2T). The results obtained demonstrated that when comparing airborne Trad and sharpened S2+3 LST, the latter tend to be underestimated. This complicates the use of TSEB-PTS2+3 to detect crop water stress. TSEB-2T appeared to outperform all the other methods. This was shown by a higher R2 and slightly lower RMSD when compared with modelled T. In addition, regressions between T and CWSI-2T with \u03a8stem also produced the highest R2. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion","id":"10.3390/rs12142299"}

Appendix A Peer reviewed While the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in agricultural soils and products has been firmly established, their distribution among the different plant parts and the contribution of agricultural practices, including irrigation with reclaimed water, have not been adequately addressed yet. To this end, we analyzed the levels of seven ARGs (sul1, blaTEM, blaCTX-M-32, mecA, qnrS1, tetM, blaOXA-58), plus the integrase gene intl1, in soils, roots, leaves, and fruits from two commercial tomato fields irrigated with either unpolluted groundwater or from a channel impacted by treated wastewater, using culture-independent, quantitative real-time PCR methods. ARGs and intl1 sequences were found in leaves and fruits at levels representing from 1 to 10% of those found in roots or soil. The relative abundance of intl1 sequences correlated with tetM, blaTEM, and sul1 levels, suggesting a high horizontal mobility potential for these ARGs. High-throughput 16S rDNA sequencing revealed microbiome differences both between sample types (soil plus roots versus leaves plus fruits) and sampling zones, and a correlation between the prevalence of Pseudomonadaceae and the levels of different ARGs, particularly in fruits and leaves.

{"text":"<jats:p>In Morocco, cereal production shows high interannual variability due to uncertain rainfall and recurrent drought periods. Considering the socioeconomic importance of cereal for the country, there is a serious need to characterize the impact of drought on cereal yields. In this study, drought is assessed through (1) indices derived from remote sensing data (the vegetation condition index (VCI), temperature condition index (TCI), vegetation health ind ex (VHI), soil moisture condition index (SMCI) and soil water index for different soil layers (SWI)) and (2) key land surface variables (Land Area Index (LAI), soil moisture (SM) at different depths, soil evaporation and plant transpiration) from a Land Data Assimilation System (LDAS) over 2000\u20132017. A lagged correlation analysis was conducted to assess the relationships between the drought indices and cereal yield at monthly time scales. The VCI and LAI around the heading stage (March-April) are highly linked to yield for all provinces (R = 0.94 for the Khemisset province), while a high link for TCI occurs during the development stage in January-February (R = 0.83 for the Beni Mellal province). Interestingly, indices related to soil moisture in the superficial soil layer are correlated with yield earlier in the season around the emergence stage (December). The results demonstrate the clear added value of using an LDAS compared with using a remote sensing product alone, particularly concerning the soil moisture in the root-zone, considered a key variable for yield production, that is not directly observable from space. The time scale of integration is also discussed. By integrating the indices on the main phenological stages of wheat using a dynamic threshold approach instead of the monthly time scale, the correlation between indices and yield increased by up to 14%. In addition, the contributions of VCI and TCI to VHI were optimized by using yield anomalies as proxies for drought. This study opens perspectives for the development of drought early warning systems in Morocco and over North Africa, as well as for seasonal crop yield forecasting.</jats:p>","id":"10.3390/rs12244018"}

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience Increasing total solids in anaerobic digestion can reduce the methane yield by highly complex bio-physical\u2013chemical mechanisms. Therefore, understanding those mechanisms and their main drivers becomes crucial to optimize this waste treatment biotechnology. In this study, seven batch experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of increasing the initial total solids in high-solids anaerobic digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste. With inoculum-to-substrate ratio\u2009=\u20091.5 g VS/g VS and maximum total solids \u2264\u200919.6%, mono-digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste showed a methane yield\u2009=\u2009174\u2013236 NmL CH4/g VS. With inoculum-to-substrate ratio \u2264\u20091.0 g VS/g VS and maximum total solids \u2265\u200924.0%, mono-digestion experiments acidified. Co-digestion of the organic fraction of municipal solid waste and beech sawdust permitted to reduce the inoculum-to-substrate ratio to 0.16 g VS/g VS while increasing total solids up to 30.2%, though achieving a lower methane yield (117\u2013156 NmL CH4/g VS). At each inoculum-to-substrate ratio, higher total solids corresponded to higher ammonia and volatile fatty acid accumulation. Thus, a 40% lower methane yield for mono-digestion was observed at a NH3 concentration \u2265\u20092.3 g N\u2013NH3/kg reactor content and total solids\u2009=\u200915.0%. Meanwhile, co-digestion lowered the nitrogen content, being the risk of acidification exacerbated only at total solids \u2265\u200920.0%. Therefore, the biodegradability of the substrate, as well as the operational total solids and inoculum-to-substrate ratio, are closely interrelated parameters determining the success of methanogenesis, but also the risk of ammonia inhibition in high-solids anaerobic digestion.","id":"10.1007/s13762-019-02264-z"}

{"text":"Open AccessTomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum) plant were provided with bio-fertilizers issued from anaerobic digestion of olive mill wastewater without and with 1%, 5% of phosphate residues in mesophilic conditions for 25 days. 1% of raw substrates (OMW raw; OMW\u2009+\u20091%PR raw; olive mill wastewater\u2009+\u20095%phosphate residues raw; and phosphate residues) and digestates (olive mill wastewater digestate, olive mill wastewater\u2009+\u20091%phosphate residues digestate and olive mill wastewater\u2009+\u20095%phosphate residues digestate) was provided fortnightly to the plants. Reclaimed water from a wastewater treatment plant located in the study site was used for automatically controlled irrigation. It contained a low level of chemical fertilizers to compare tomato plant growth, leaf analysis, steam water potential, production yield and fruit quality results to plants fed with bio-fertilizers. Generally, parameters and results were progressively increased during the growing and harvesting stage, which refer to the essential elements that cover the plant\u2019s needs. Plants fed with bio-fertilizers showed the most extended plant height (olive mill wastewater\u2009+\u20095% phosphate residues raw), and the best accumulation of essential elements in leaves (olive mill wastewater\u2009+\u20091% phosphate residues digestate and olive mill wastewater\u2009+\u20095%phosphate residues digestate). The maximum average fruit weight per treatment (35.5 g) was obtained when applying the digestates mixture of olive mill wastewater raw and olive mill wastewater\u2009+\u20095% phosphate residues. The maximum yield production per plant was obtained when applying phosphates residues. Bio-fertilizers (digestates) showed good performances, high fruit quality and perfect tomato yield production compared to the control plants. Results obtained during this study are considered promising regarding environmental framework. However, this study was done in a laboratory scale and needs to be applied in a large scale to provide more data on the effectiveness of the digestates application. It is also recommended to apply these bio-fertilizers on different crops and various soils for a better evaluation.

{"text":"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the attempt to foster circular economy (CE), cities are increasingly adopting urban living labs (ULLs) as sites of co-production aimed at testing alternative solutions based on the reuse of products, reduction of consumption and recycling of materials. Taking this perspective, our study adopts an exploratory research design to discover the pragmatic implications emerging from a case study. The City of Turin joined proGIreg, a European project that entails the regeneration of former industrial districts by means of nature-based solutions (NBS). Ranging from aquaponics to green roofs, seven NBS have been experimented in Turin, which rely on the use of natural systems to tackle social, economic and environmental challenges efficiently and sustainably. Among them, the most promising is related to the production and test of the \u2018<jats:italic>new soil</jats:italic>\u2019, a blend obtained by mixing earth materials coming from construction sites with compost, zeolites and mycorrhizae. The case herein presented is interesting to analyse for the multi-stakeholder management setting used, where public institutions, private companies, research institutions, citizens and associations collaborated in the co-creation and testing phase of the NBS. Consequently, the data collected through participant observation and direct interviews allow researchers to describe multi-stakeholders\u2019 dynamics and how they work. Thus, this paper narrates a micro-contextual experience while providing a critique. Results include an analysis of the unique combination of different stakeholders, which strongly impacted on the management and the effectiveness of the entire project. By consequence, the paper offers both theoretical contributions to the relational branch of stakeholder theory and practical evidence in demonstrating the importance of the relational branch of the theory over a more traditional transactional view.</jats:p>","id":"10.1007/s43615-021-00011-6"}

{"text":"Abstract: Identifying priority areas is an essential step in developing management strategies to reduce pesticide loads in surface water. A spatially explicit model-based approach was developed to detect priority areas for diffuse pesticide pollution at catchment scale. The method uses available datasets and considers different pesticide pathways in the environment post-application. The approach was applied in a catchment area in SE Flanders (Belgium) as a case study. Calculated risk areas were obtained using detailed landscape data and combining pesticide emissions and hydrological connectivity. The risk areas obtained were further compared with an alternative observation-based method, developed specifically for this study site that includes long-term field observations and local expert knowledge. Both methods equally classified 50% of the areas. The impact of crop rotation on the calculated risk was analysed. High-risk areas were identified and added to a cumulative map over all five years to evaluate temporal variations. The model-based approach was used for the initial identification of risk areas at the study site. The tool helps to prioritise zones and detect particular fields to target landscape mitigation measures to reduce diffuse pesticide pollution reaching surface water bodies.","id":"10.1016/J.JENVMAN.2019.04.120"}

{"text":"Abstract   Geoarchaeological studies have benefits from new technological developments in remote-sensing technologies that have become an integral and important part of the archeological researches. In particular, structure-from-motion (SfM) photogrammetry is one of the most successful emerging techniques in high-resolution topography (HRT) and provides exceptionally fast, low-cost, and easy three-dimensional (3D) survey for geoscience applications. In this chapter, we present an example of SfM application for geoarchaeology. The purpose is to realize HRT digital terrain models (DTMs) of an area of prehistoric agricultural terracing together with a geoarchaeological excavation trench in the Ingram Valley, Northumberland National Park, NE England. The study area is one of the six pilot case studies of TerrACE archeological research project (ERC-2017-ADG: 787790, 2018\u20132023;  https://www.terrace.no/ ), a 5-year European Research Council grant funded by the European Union. An integrated approach utilizing ground-based and UAV (nadir and oblique) images was used to preserve fine-grained topographic detail and permit the accurate survey of highly vegetated areas and steep or subvertical surfaces (e.g., vertical walls of terraces), while also allowing for the capture of large spatial datasets. The SfM-DTM provided an accurate and high level of detail of the terrace landscape, the archeological features, and the soil and sediment stratigraphy along the excavation trench. An additional terrace was identified that had not been recognized before due to the HRT study bringing out a level of detail that had not been previously observable in this area. The SfM 3D outputs allowed the extraction of profiles, sections, scaled plans, and orthomosaics of the terrace complex and the excavation trench, simplifying and speeding the archeologist's field and laboratory work. SfM has shown it to be a rapid, cost effective, and highly accurate technique for surveying archeological sites at both a landscape and localized scale and adding new and more accurate information in nationally important landscapes and beyond.","id":"10.1016/b978-0-444-64177-9.00006-0"}

{"text":"Open AccessPeer reviewed During wetting-drying cycles, divergence is often found between the immediately improved soil water conditions after re-watering and the recovery of plant water status from stress, which ensues only gradually. Such an apparent hysteresis effect of water stress (HEWS) is usually neglected in simulating root-water-uptake (RWU) by empirical models. To consider HEWS in the empirical macroscopic RWU model of Feddes, a water stress recovery coefficient (\u03b4) was introduced based on two lysimetric experiments under greenhouse and field conditions for winter wheat. The integrated effects of historical water stress events were investigated by assuming that the normalized influence weight of each past stress event declines with the increase of time interval before simulation as an exponential function of attenuation rate. Although \u03b4 could be described by an exponential function of an integrative index representing the general historical stress extent (R2 = 0.65, P < 0.001), with an attenuation rate smaller than 0.13, it is challenging to establish such a function practically. An attenuation rate close to zero means HEWS is mainly dominated by the water stress on the previous day, validated by a significant relationship between the relative transpiration or stomatal conductance on the day after irrigation and the water stress extent on the day before irrigation. Therefore, a simplification, substituting the integrative index in the exponential function with the stress extent on the previous day, was proposed for estimating \u03b4. Compared to the traditional RWU model, the revised model considering HEWS was more successful in simulating relative transpiration and soil water dynamics. Root mean square error of relative transpiration was reduced by 65.9 % and of soil water by 30 % in the greenhouse experiment and by 7.4 % and 12.5 %, respectively, in the field experiment.

{"text":"Abstract   Rainwater is a primary water source for the hilly and gully region of the Loess Plateau where an improved efficiency of rainwater utilization is crucial for sustainable agricultural development. A new system, comprised of rainwater harvesting, concentrating infiltration with multi-holed pipe and mulching (RIM), was designed to sustain soil moisture at a proper level in rain-fed orchards in the hilly and gully loess region of China. This study monitored changes in soil moisture and distribution over soil profiles using four treatments: (a) RIM1 with two rainwater harvesting areas, two infiltration pipes and film mulching, (b) RIM2 with one rainwater harvesting area, one infiltration pipe and film mulching, (c) film mulching (FM) only and (d) traditional apple orchard as a control treatment (CK) as a baseline in this experiment. The results showed that mean soil moisture content (SMC) in a range of soil layer between 0 cm and 300 cm for RIM1 and RIM2 treatments increased by 43.01% and 34.78% in 2018 and 30.55% and 26.41% in 2019, respectively. Dividing the soil vertical profile into three layers, i.e., an easy-changing layer (0\u221260 cm), an increasing or decreasing layer (60\u2212180 cm), and a relatively steady layer (180\u2212300 cm), this study examined the vertical changes of soil moisture. The RIM1 and RIM2 treatments induced a large increase in the size and depth of wetted areas over the whole soil layers. The soil moisture was replenished to a horizontal distance of 1.5 m and 2.5 m apart from the trunk within the soil layer between 60 cm and 300 cm under the RIM1 treatment while only the horizontal distance of 1.5 m apart from the trunk under the RIM2 treatment. While the seasonal variation of SMC in the easy-changing soil layer (0\u221260 cm) corresponded to precipitation consistently, the SMC in the deep soil layers (60\u2212300 cm) was not sensitive to precipitation. As a result, the treatments of RIM1, RIM2 and FM improved apple yield and crop water productivity compared with those under the control treatment. In particular, the RIM1 treatment performed the best among the treatments investigated in this study. The results highlighted the efficiency of the RIM system in enhancing the soil moisture, which may be useful to improve an orchard production for rain-fed orchards in the loess hilly and gully region of China.","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106496"}

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience The main goal of this research was to evaluate the potential of the HYDRUS-1D numerical model for estimating the soil moisture (\u03b8) at different depths, actual crop evapotranspiration (ETa) and its components (crop transpiration, Ta and soil evaporation, Ea) as well as the deep percolation (DP) of irrigated winter wheat under different water managements in the semi-arid region of Tensift-basin (central Morocco). The HYDRUS-1D simulations were performed at daily time step during the two growing seasons: 2002/2003 and 2015/2016. The model was firstly calibrated based on one field 'denoted F1' data during the 2002/2003 cropping season by using the Levenberg-Marquardt method implemented in HYDRUS-1D model for optimizing various parameters of Van Genuchten equation that provide the minimum difference between measured and simulated soil moisture at four layers of soil (0-5, 5-10, 10-20, 20-30, 30-50 cm). Afterwards, the model validation was done based on the data from four fields of wheat: two fields 'denoted F2 and F3' during the 2002/2003 and two other fields 'denoted F4 and F5' during the 2015/2016 cropping season. All fields were irrigated with flooding system except the field F5 where drip irrigation was undertaken. In-situ measurements of \u03b8 was carried out using Time Domain Reflectometry (TDR) and gravimetric method ETa was measured by the Eddy Covariance system Ta and Ea were monitored using a lysimeter in F5 field. The results showed that the HYDRUS-1D model simulates the \u03b8, ETa, Ta and Ea reasonably well. Additionally, the evaluation of the irrigation system on DP losses was investigated by comparing the simulation results over flood (F4) and drip (F5) irrigated fields. It was found that about 56% and 20% of seasonal supplied water were lost by DP in F4 and F5 sites, respectively. Such unexpected high amount of DP taking place in F5 field is due to the improper use of the drip irrigation system..","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106546"}

{"text":"International audience; Currently, the AquaCrop model has been widely tested for many fruit/grain crops; root and tuber crops; leafy vegetables, or forage crops, but is restricted to annual herbaceous species, while deciduous crops have received less if no attention. In this context, this study aims to test for the first time the ability of the AquaCrop model to simulate canopy cover (CC), actual evapotranspiration (ETa), total soil water content (TWC), biomass (B) and fruit yield (FY) of table grapes vineyards (Vitis vinifera L., cvs. Perlette and Superior) at the Costa de Hermosillo, Sonora in Northwest Mexico. Observed weather and soil physical parameters, with measured crop parameters from an experiment conducted during 2005 were used to develop climate, soil and crop input files for AquaCrop and for calibrating the model. While collected data during the 2006 growing season were used to validate the model. The model adequately simulated CC, ETa and TWC during 2005 and 2006. The Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) between observed and measured CC, ETa and TWC were 5.18%, 0.46 mm/day and 10.11 mm during 2005, and 8.82%, 0.84 mm/day and 9.1 mm during 2006, respectively. The good accuracy of simulations of CC, ETa and TWC by the model have been confirmed by additional statistical parameters like the coefficient of determination (R 2), The Mean Bias Error (MBE), the Willmott's index of agreement (d) and the Nash-Sutcliffe Efficiency (NSE).For the B and FY simulations, the results showed that the model correctly reproduced the B and FY with NRMSE value of 8.8%. The estimated average value of FY (14.56 t/ha) for both seasons are in the range of the potential yield (14-18 t/ha) of table grapes in the irrigated Costa de Hermosillo in northwest Mexico.After the validation of the AquaCrop model, it was used to evaluate the irrigation scheduling by the farmer as well as to assess the water productivity computed as the ratio of crop production to crop water use. The results showed that, the recommended irrigation by the model was about 547 mm and 509 mm, which it is about half of that applied by the farmer (1006 mm and 929 mm) during 2005 and 2006, respectively. This large difference, which represents approximately 54% and 57% of the irrigation supply, is lost through deep percolation and could be saved without vegetation suffering from water stress while maintaining the same yield. The high loss of water by percolation affects significantly the water productivity (WP), which decreases from 3.22 to 1.74 kg/m 3 if we consider the transpiration (WP Tr), and the sum of ETa and Percolation (WP ETa+Pr) for WP computations, respectively. Consequently, the AquaCrop model can be used as an operational tool by decision makers and growers to improve irrigation management. This is of crucial importance in arid and semi-arid regions where water is becoming increasingly scarce.","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2020.106585"}

Peer reviewed Knowledge-driven 'smart' irrigation proposes to achieve explicitly targeted crop yield and/or irrigation water use efficiency (WUE). A coupled crop growth and soil water transport model was established and applied to schedule irrigation for drip-irrigated and film-mulched maize through numerical simulation. By designing various scenarios with either a constant or variable threshold of plant water deficit index (PWDI) to initiate irrigation, the quantitative relationship between PWDI threshold and the corresponding yield and WUE was investigated with acceptable errors between the measured and simulated values (R2 > 0.85). The model allowed determination of PWDI thresholds designed to reach specific combinations of yield and WUE to consider actual conditions such as availability and cost of water resources. Regulated deficit irrigation with a variable threshold, considering variability of physiological response to water stress, was superior to a constant PWDI threshold in improving WUE. A constant PWDI threshold of 0.54 and 45 threshold combinations among various growth stages were suggested to obtain same relative values of yield and WUE. Numerical simulation has the potential to provide reliable dynamic information regarding soil water and crop growth, necessary for smart irrigation scheduling, due to its ability in integrating the effects of environmental conditions and economic considerations and, as such, should be further studied to enhance simulation accuracy and subsequently to optimize irrigation scheduling under complex situations.

{"text":"Abstract   Crop evapotranspiration (ET) is a fundamental component of the hydrological cycle, especially in arid/semi-arid regions. The FAO-56 offers an operational method for deriving ET from the reduction (dual crop coefficient Kc) of the atmospheric evaporative demand (ET0). The dual coefficient approach (FAO-2Kc) is intended to improve the daily estimation of ET by separating the contribution of bare soil evaporation (E) and crop transpiration components. The FAO-2Kc has been a well-known reference for the operational monitoring of crop water needs. However, its performance for estimating the water use efficiency is limited by uncertainties in the modeled evaporation/transpiration partitioning. This paper aims at improving the soil module of the FAO-2Kc by modifying the E reduction coefficient (Kr) according to soil texture information and state-of-the-art formulations, hence, to amend the mismatch between FAO-2Kc and field-measured data beyond standard conditions. In practice this work evaluates the performance of two evaporation models, using the classical Kr (Kr,FAO) and a new texture-based Kr (Kr,text) over 33 bare soil sites under different evaporative demand and soil conditions. An offline validation is investigated by forcing both models with observed soil moisture (     \u03b8    s     ) data as input. The Kr,text methodology provides more accurate E estimations compared to the Kr,FAO method and systematically reduces biases. Using Kr,text allows reaching the lowest root means square error (RMSE) of 0.16\u2009mm/day compared to the Kr,FAO where the lowest RMSE reached is 0.88\u2009mm/day. As a step further in the assessment of the proposed methodology, ET was estimated in three wheat fields across the entire agricultural season. Both approaches were thus inter-compared in terms of ET estimates forced by SM estimated as a residual of the water balance model (online validation). Compared to ET measurements, the new formulation provided more accurate results. The RMSE was 0.66\u2009mm/day (0.71\u2009mm/day) and the R2 was 0.83 (0.78) for the texture-based (classical) Kr.","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2021.106827"}

{"text":"Field high-throughput phenotyping (HTPP) studies are highly needed to study water use efficiency (WUE), stress tolerance capacities, yield and quality in tomato to improve crop breeding strategies and adapt them to the climatic change scenario. In this study, UAV remote sensing is tested by comparison with leaf-level physiologic and agronomic measurements in a collection including 91 tomato genotypes. These genotypes include long shelf-life (LSL) and non-LSL (CON) Mediterranean landraces, cultivated under well-watered (WW, covering 100% crop evapotranspiration demands) and water deficit (WD, irrigation stopped one month after plantlet transplantation to field) conditions. Aerial remote sensing (including multispectral imaging), leaf gas-exchange, leaf carbon isotope composition (\ufffd\ufffd<sup>13</sup>C), fruit production and quality measurements, including total soluble solids and acidity, were performed. Differences between CON and LSL genotypes were observed in leaf-level physiologic and remote sensing measurements under both WW and WD conditions, while for agronomic measurements differences were only found for quality traits under WW conditions. Significant relationships were detected between remote sensing and leaf-level physiologic and agronomic measurements when considering all genotypes and treatments. However, different regressions were described for CON and LSL genotypes, mainly due their different physiologic behavior and response to WD. For instance, for the same NDVI value LSL genotypes showed near 30% lower A<sub>N</sub> and half g<sub>s</sub> than CON, and therefore higher intrinsic water use efficiency (WUE<sub>i</sub>). Also, tomato fruit quality was approached through remote sensing measurements, being correlated with multispectral indices. In conclusion, this study shows how remote sensing can help to optimize tomato physiologic and agronomic phenotyping processes. However, it also points out that the inclusion of genotypes with a different water use efficiency behavior and response to WD lead to a large scattering in the relationships between remote sensing and physiologic and agronomic traits and prevents to obtention of reliable models.","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2021.107283"}

In arid and semi-arid regions, water scarcity and soil salinization are major factors impacting sustainable agricultural production. In this study, a macroscopic root-water-uptake model was used to adapt a plant water deficit index (PWDI) for irrigation scheduling under conditions of coexisting soil water and salinity stress-causing factors. The traditional approach, estimating PWDI with average root zone soil water and salt amounts, was improved by weighting the effects of soil water and salinity according to the normalized root length density profile. An experiment growing wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in soil columns and an experiment growing cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) in a salinized field were implemented to explore and quantify the effects of soil water and salinity conditions on plant water status, and thus to validate the improvement and evaluate its application, by monitoring soil water and salinity dynamics and plant growth indexes (e.g., leaf area, dry weight, leaf water potential, transpiration and yield). The results indicate that, even under conditions with equal root zone averages of soil matric and osmotic potentials, plant water status might be significantly different. In general, plants were less stressed when more water and less salinity were allocated in the upper root zone with more roots while less water and more salinity occurred in the lower root zone with less roots. By referring to some information in the soil column experiment, a numerical experiment was conducted to further demonstrate the improvement. The root-weighted approach resulted in improved PWDI estimation and thus was more reliable for irrigation scheduling, leading to higher irrigation frequency and quantity, leaf area index, biomass, yield, and transpiration, without significant decrease in water productivity. However, further improvement could be possible by considering the effects of historical soil water and salinity stresses as well as meteorological conditions on plant water status.

Imprecise irrigation hinders the sustainable development of the fruit tree\u2013crop intercropping system in the Loess Gully Area of China. Drip fertigation was applied for two years as part of an apple\u2013soybean intercropping system to optimize local water and nutrient management patterns. The effects of different drip irrigation and fertilizer levels on photosynthetic characteristics, soil nutrients, and their interspecific competitions were studied. The treatments were four irrigation levels, namely 60% (W1), 70% (W2), 80% (W3), and 90% (W4) of field capacity (Fc), and three nitrogen fertilization levels, namely 59 (F1), 92 (F2), and 124 kg\u2219ha\u20131 (F3). The control (CK) was a rain-fed (neither irrigation nor fertilizer) crop. The net photosynthetic rate (Pn), transpiration rate (Tr), and soybean yield (GY) increased at first, but then decreased as irrigation and fertilizer application levels rose. The partial factor productivity (PFP) decreased as fertilization increased, but the soil available nitrogen content showed the opposite trend. The soil nutrients, and soybean Pn and Tr were positively correlated with distance from the apple tree row. The interspecific competition intensity for light and soil water decreased from 2018 to 2019, while root and soil nitrate nitrogen (NN) increased. The interspecific competition correlation between the aboveground and belowground parts was weak and varied between the two intercropping years. A principal component analysis showed that treatment W3F2 had the highest comprehensive score. Thus, a combination of irrigation at 80% Fc and 92 kg\u2219ha\u20131 nitrogen fertilizer application is optimal for the system. A multiple regression analysis indicated a water input range of 4624.49\u20134795.75 m3\u00b7ha\u22121\u00b7a\u22121 combined with 84.10\u2013107.27 kg\u00b7ha\u22121\u00b7a\u22121 fertilizer application was suitable for optimal irrigation and fertilization management based on the integrated benefits to root length density, GY, Pn, and PFP during the first 4\u20135 years of the intercropping system.","id":"10.1016/j.agwat.2022.108001"}

{"text":"Abstract   Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are promoted as biofertilizers for cleaner agricultural production. So far, most researchers have investigated the effects of AMF on plant growth under highly controlled conditions with sterilized soil. However, how the soil microbial community shapes AMF\u2019s impact on host plant performance is still poorly documented. To focus on the impact of belowground interactions (plant-AMF-soil microbes) alone, we compared sterilized versus non-sterilized soil, inoculating maize (Zea mays ssp. mays) seedlings with five commercial AMF inoculants (Claroideoglomus claroideum, Funneliformis mosseae, Gigaspora sp., Rhizophagus irregularis and Scutellospora sp.). Plants were pot-cultivated for nine weeks using soil which had been used for maize monocropping in the field. AMF inoculation was successful, despite an abundant native AMF community. As hypothesized: i) the soil microbial community interfered with AMF\u2019s benefits for maize growth; ii) these benefits depended on the AMF species, as C. claroideum, F. mosseae and Gigaspora sp. overruled the soil\u2019s legacy from maize monocropping. When plants were grown in sterilized soil, we found little to no effects of AMF inoculation on maize growth and nutrients acquisition. AMF\u2019s benefits to the host plants could not be explained by improved nutrition alone, since interaction with the remainder soil microbes also differed between inoculated AMF. Data show that the soil microbial community and AMF species should be taken into consideration when applying AMF inoculants in agriculture.","id":"10.1016/j.apsoil.2017.12.025"}

Despite recognition that several factors influence this relationship, there is a lack of systematic studies analyzing the heterogeneity of these results. To fill such a gap, this study performs a systematic review and meta-analysis to understand which factors influence this relationship and how. Selected studies were sampled between 2007 and 2017 from Web of Science, PubMed, Google Scholar and Scopus using keywords and Boolean operators. Results of the systematic review show that dental fluorosis affects individuals of all ages, with the highest prevalence below 11, while the impact of other factors (gender, environmental conditions, diet and dental caries) was inconclusive. Meta-regression analysis, based on information collected through systematic review, indicates that both fluoride in drinking water and temperature influence dental fluorosis significantly and that these studies might be affected by publication bias. Findings show that fluoride negatively affects people's health in less developed countries.

{"text":"<p>The Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) can be used to derive accurately the Zenith Tropospheric Delay (ZTD) under all-weather conditions. The derived ZTDs play a vital role in climate studies, weather forecasting and are operationally assimilated into numerical weather prediction models. In this study, variations and statistical analysis of GNSS-derived ZTD over the East African tropical region are analysed. The data is collected from 13 geodetic permanent stations for the period of 4 years from 2013 to 2016. The 13 stations consist of 5 International GNSS Service (IGS) stations plus 8 stations as follows: 4 Africa Array stations and 4 Malawi Rifting stations from Uganda, Kenya, Tanzania and Rwanda. The ZTD time series were processed using goGPS software version 1.0 beta1, a MATLAB based GNSS processing software, originally developed for kinematic applications but recently re-engineered for quasi static applications. The annual variation of the ZTD time series was investigated using Lomb Scargle periodograms. The semi-annual frequency has the dominant power in subregion 1 (latitudes 4 \u00b0S and 4 \u00b0N) and the annual frequency has the dominant power in subregion 2 (latitudes 12 \u00b0S to 4 \u00b0S). The highest ZTD estimates occur during the rainy seasons, at all stations, and the lowest estimates occur during the dry seasons. The results also show that the ZTD estimates are largest at stations located at low elevation (regions close to the Indian Ocean). The derived ZTDs are compared to the values derived from the GIPSY-OASIS via Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) online Automatic Precise Positioning Service (APPS) and the Unified Environmental Modelling System (UEMS) numerical weather prediction (NWP) model. The comparison of goGPS and APPS ZTD at the 13 stations shows an overall average bias, Root Mean Square (RMS) and standard deviation (stdev) of \u22120.9 mm, 3.2 mm and 3.0 mm respectively, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.974 to 0.999. The comparison of goGPS ZTD against UEMS NWP ZTD at 8 selected stations shows average bias, RMS and stdev of \u221212.4 mm, 22.0 mm and 17.6 mm respectively, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0.802 to 0.974. The agreement between the GPS ZTD and the NWP ZTD indicates that goGPS ZTD can be assimilated into NWP models in the East African region.</p> Green Open Access added to TU Delft Institutional Repository \u2018You share, we take care!\u2019 \u2013 Taverne project https://www.openaccess.nl/en/you-share-we-take-care Otherwise as indicated in the copyright section: the publisher is the copyright holder of this work and the author uses the Dutch legislation to make this work public.

{"text":"Abstract   Residues of antibiotics are promoting antibiotic resistance of environmental microbiota which is identified as one of the most crucial global challenge for health security. Photocatalysis has been regarded as a desirable technology for organic pollutant removal, but is underappreciated in degradation of persistent organic pollutants due to the low adsorption capacity and photocatalytic efficiency of photocatalysts. In this study, a scalable photocatalyst of single/few-layered carbon nitride nanosheets with carbon vacancies (Cv-CNNs) is synthesized through a thermal process. Quantum mechanical simulation results reveal that the C vacancies can change the plane structure of CN sheets, enhancing adsorption capability of Cv-CNNs towards sulfadiazine (SDZ, a refractory antibiotic pollutant). Furthermore, the introduction of C vacancies in Cv-CNNs enhance the redox capacity, promoting photocatalytic hydrogen evolution and SDZ degradation. The removal efficiency of SDZ (5\u202fmg L\u22121) reaches almost 100% within 20\u202fmin under visible-light irradiation. In addition, the photocatalyst delivers a high H2 evolution rate of 2.03\u202fmmol\u202fh\u22121 g\u22121. The study provides a large-scale-production metal-free photocatalyst for practical application in antibiotics removal from wastewater or solar-to-hydrogen energy conversion.","id":"10.1016/j.cej.2019.123017"}

{"text":"Cavitation used to be associated with negative outcomes in hydraulic turbomachinery but nowadays it is often used for water cleaning, microorganism\u2019s destruction and degradation of organic compounds. This study investigated the amount of \u00b7OH formed during hydrodynamic cavitation using salicylic acid dosimetry. The radical\u2019s amount was evaluated by quantifying the concentration of 2,3-dihydroxybenzoic acid, catechol and 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid. Two concentrations of the dosimeter in tap water were investigated, 50 and 300 mg L$^{\u22121}$ (pH approx. 2.5). After 90 min of cavitation using a Venturi constriction a sum of the three products was determined at 0.97 \u00b5g mL$^{\u22121}$ and 1.81 \u00b5g mL$^{\u22121}$, respectively. However, during the investigation the anomalies were detected in the cavitation development when higher concentration of salicylic acid was used \u2013 cavitation appeared more gentle, with less intense collapses, unrelated to the one in pure water. Detailed observations of cavitation and additional bubble dynamics simulations revealed that the decreased surface tension of the acidified salicylic acid solution is the most influential physical characteristic. Further experiments on nucleation and coalescence showed that high concentration of salicylic acid also leads to longer stability of the bubbles and prevents their coalescence due to short-range repulsive forces (steric hindrance), which results in less violent bubble collapse. We also discuss the importance of an appropriate amount of the dosimeter for correct evaluation of \u00b7OH production in a given cavitation device (50 mg L$^{\u22121}$ for the present one). This is essential for further cavitation exploitation studies to avoid false interpretation of the gathered results.","id":"10.1016/j.cej.2020.125389"}

The presented research has been performed within project H2020 No. 773903 Shui, focused on water scarcity in European and Chinese cropping systems. In the face of future climate change, Europe has encouraged the adoption of biofuel crops by its farmers. Such land-use changes can have significant impacts on the water balance and hydrological behavior of a system. While the heavy pesticide use associated with biofuel crops has been extensively studied, the water balance impacts of these crops have been far less studied. We conducted scenario analyses using the Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) to determine the effects of farm-scale biofuel crop adoption (rapeseed) on a basin\u2019s water balance. We found that rapeseed adoption does not support the goal of developing a sustainable agricultural landscape in the Czech Republic. The adoption of rapeseed also had disproportionate effects on a basin\u2019s water balance depending on its location in the basin. Additionally, discharge (especially surface runoff ratios), evapotranspiration, and available soil water content display significant shifts in the rapeseed adoption scenarios.","id":"10.3390/su122410596"}

{"text":"Abstract   Microbial electrochemical technologies (MET) are increasingly being considered for environmental remediation applications, mainly for their unique capability to enhance microbial degradation processes in an environmentally sustainable manner (e.g., without requiring addition of chemicals and with little or even no energy consumption). To date, however, the application of MET for the remediation of saturated and unsaturated soils contaminated by petroleum hydrocarbons (PH) remains challenged by a number of environmental and operational factors which have, so far, hampered a more rapid deployment of the technology. In this context, this critical review has comprehensively analyzed the recent scientific literature dealing with electrobioremediation of PH-contaminated soils, in order to disentangle the impact of key process parameters (e.g., type of electrodes, system configurations, design criteria) and environmental conditions (e.g., soil characteristics and strategies to manipulate thereof, type of contaminants, composition of PH-degrading communities) on the overall remediation performance. Interestingly, the analysis revealed that MET-based soil electrobioremediation has been successfully applied to remove a variety of PH (from alkanes to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and mixtures thereof) from soils displaying a broad range of electric conductivities (0.2\u20136 mS/cm), using different system configurations (from simple graphite rod buried within soils to more complex tubular electrode assemblies). To date, the limited radius-of-influence of electrodes buried in contaminated soils, which is typically lower than 50\u00a0cm, appears to be a main limiting factor which requires specific strategies (e.g., amendment of soil with conductive materials/minerals and/or surfactants) to be properly addressed. Finally, the study highlights the urgent need for pilot-scale testing to confirm the promising results obtained at the laboratory-scale under more controlled, yet often far-less representative, conditions as well as to catalyze the commercial and societal interest towards this novel technology.","id":"10.1016/j.cej.2021.130008"}

{"text":"METland\u00ae technology consists of a bioengineering strategy for treating wastewater by integrating microbial electrochemical concepts into constructed wetland systems to enhance pollutants removal. In this context, we have constructed planted (Iris sibirica) biofilters to assess the impact of different electrically conductive bed materials (electroconductive coke, electroconductive biochar, non-electroconductive biochar and gravel) by analyzing the (i) wastewater treatment efficiency (COD and nitrogen removal), (ii) bioelectrochemical response, and (iii) diversity of microbial communities. Electrically conductive materials outperformed non-conductive ones allowing removal rates as high as 175-180 gCOD/bed*m3 day capable to support footprint as low 0.4 m2/pe. In contrast, the highest nitrogen removal rates were achieved with non-conductive biochar in presence of plants (80 %) regardless the anoxic conditions of the assay. This was confirmed by the presence of annamox bacteria like Planctomycetes. Furthermore, the presence of a marked electric potential profile along the bed height in electroconductive materials together with redox pairs (cyclic voltammetry analysis) demonstrated an effective electron flow from bottom to uppermost layers of the bed (geoconductor mechanism). In electroconductive biochar, such effective conductivity-based model co-exists with a geobattery mechanism due to presence of electroactive phenolic and carbonyl/quinone groups and/or microporosity. Microbial biodiversity analysis revealed the impact of plants just at the upper layers of the biofilters where roots and Rhizobium predominate. Bacteria from genus Clostridium were dominant in gravel inert material; in contrast, bacteria from genus Geobacter (12%) and Trichococcus (30%) outcompete the rest of communities for an effective colonization of carbonaceous beds, suggesting their main role as part of the electrosyntrophies mechanism after METland\u00ae.

{"text":"Open AccessOpen Access funding provided thanks to the CRUE-CSIC agreement with Elsevier Economic options to retrofit wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) without tertiary treatments need to be explored. In this regard, bioelectrochemical systems (BES) can be hybridized with existing technologies, upgrading the removal performance of original techniques while avoiding replacement costs. Yet, few demonstrations of merged systems have been given. For the first time, in this work it was built a lab-scale model of a BES merged with a secondary settler, namely e-settler, to enhance the polishing performance of already existing WWTPs. In particular, to concomitantly increase nitrogen removal and perform wastewater (WW) disinfection, avoiding further tertiary treatments. In the e-settlers, nitrogen removal was increased through bioelectrochemical stimulation. Concomitant ammonium and nitrate removal without nitrite accumulation and a negligible amount of nitrous oxide emissions were observed. Ti-MMO as anode material showed a high disinfectant action. In conclusion, it was demonstrated how a simple bioelectrochemical set-up can upgrade existing WWTPs. The following step requires the study at a larger scale, identifying optimal operational and structural parameters for the in-situ application. The main limitations of the e-settlers were discussed, linking them to possible solutions that need to be deepened in a lab-scale model of conventional secondary treatments (activated sludge followed by secondary settler) This work was funded through: the ELECTRA project [grant agreement no. 826244], which was financially supported by the Horizon 2020 programme of the European Union; the NSFC-EU Environmental Biotechnology joint program (No. 31861133001); the Key Research and Development Project of Shandong Province (No. 2020CXGC011202).

{"text":"\u00a9 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Techna Group S.r.l. Conducted research presents a rapid and cost-effective approach to technological processing of screen-printed films with anatase TiO2 nanoparticles, by utilizing the high fluence laser radiation. The influence of laser sintering on the screen-printed films was characterized with optical and scanning electron microscopy, energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectroscopy, Raman spectroscopy, nanoindenter measurements and current vs voltage measurements. Investigation of surface morphology of screen-printed films revealed that higher laser fluences caused significant decrease in film thickness, trough evaporation of organic additives used in the paste matrix. EDX mapping of carbon content in untreated and laser sintered surface confirmed removal of organic additives. Laser sintering stimulated breaking of large agglomerates into much finer nano-sized particles and promoted formation of necking between individual grains. Crystal structure and vibrational properties of anatase TiO2 nanoparticles was monitored with Raman spectroscopy before and after laser sintering. Obtained results point out that anatase polymorph was preserved during the sintering process, without appearance of other phases. From observation of the behavior of the most intense Eg Raman active mode it was deduced that laser sintering provoked a formation of structural defects i.e. oxygen vacancies in TiO2 nanoparticles, whose concentration increased in the samples treated with higher laser fluences. Mechanical properties of untreated and laser sintered samples were investigated with nanoindenter measurements using several load forces, in order to carefully probe the Young modulus and mechanical hardness. From the analysis of collected data, we established that overall improvement of the mechanical properties with laser sintering originates from formation of very dense ceramic layer with enhanced interconnectivity between individual TiO2 nanoparticles. Measurements of current vs voltage characteristics clearly demonstrated that increase in laser fluence leads to drastic increase in current values and improvement of electric conductivity.","id":"10.1016/j.ceramint.2018.03.181"}

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience We report a new method for precise analysis of gallium (Ga) isotopic composition in geological samples. The purification of Ga is achieved by a three-step ion exchange chromatography to remove matrix and interfering elements. The 71 Ga/ 69 Ga ratios are analyzed by multi-collector inductively-coupled-plasma mass-spectrometer (MC-ICP-MS). The external reproducibility of the measurements (0.05\u2030, 2 s.d.) was assessed by replicate analyses of the USGS BCR-2 and BHVO-2 standards. This newly developed technique was then used to investigate the extent of Ga isotopic fractionation during igneous processes by analyzing well-characterized samples from the Kilauea Iki lava lake, USA. These samples were formed in a closed system and have MgO contents ranging from 26.9 to 2.4 wt.%. We found that igneous processes do not fractionate Ga isotopes within the analytical uncertainty and that the Ga isotopic composition of mafic-ultramafic lavas can be used to estimate the composition of their mantle source. Twelve ocean island basalts, two mid-ocean-ridge basalts, one continental flood basalt and one komatiite have homogeneous and nearly identical Ga isotopic compositions within analytical uncertainties averaging 0.00 \u00b1 0.06\u2030 (2 s.d.).

{"text":"International audience; The terrestrial planets are depleted in volatile elements with respect to chondritic meteorites, their possible building blocks. However, the timing, extent and origin of volatile depletion is debated. Zinc is a moderately volatile element (MVE), whose stable isotopic composition can distinguish when and where this depletion took place. Here, we report data for 40 ultramafic rocks comprising pristine upper mantle peridotites from the Balmuccia orogenic lherzolite massif and Archean komatiites that together define the Zn isotope composition of the Earth's primitive mantle. Peridotites and komatiites are shown to have indistinguishable Zn isotopic compositions of delta Zn-66 = + 0.16 +/- 0.06% (2SD), (with delta Zn-66 the per mille deviation of Zn-66/Zn-64 from the JMC-Lyon standard), implying a constant Zn isotope composition for the silicate Earth since 3.5 Ga. After accounting for Zn sequestration during core formation, the Earth falls on the volatile-depleted end of a carbonaceous chondrite array in delta Zn-66-Zn/Mg space, implying Earth avoided modification of its MVE budgets during late accretion (e.g. during a giant impact), in contrast to the Moon. The Moon deviates from the chondritic array in a manner consistent with evaporative loss of Zn, where its delta Zn-66 co-varies with Mn/Na, implying post-nebular volatile loss is more pronounced on smaller bodies. Should the giant impact deliver the Earth's volatile complement of Pb and Ag, it cannot account for the budget of lithophile MVEs (e.g. Zn, Rb, Mn), whose abundances reflect those of Earth's nebular building blocks. The Earth initially accreted from material that experienced chemical- and mass-dependent isotopic fractionation akin to carbonaceous chondrites, though volatile depletion was more pronounced on Earth.","id":"10.1016/j.chemgeo.2017.12.006"}

{"text":"International audience; Zirconium plays a major role in geochemistry as it is the major cation of zircons - the oldest preserved minerals on Earth. While Zr isotopic anomalies in meteorites have been widely studied, mass dependant Zr stable isotope fractionation during geological processing has been untouched. Here, we report Zr stable isotopic data for terrestrial igneous rocks and present a novel method for the determination of Zr stable isotope ratios within natural geological materials using ion exchange, double-spike, multiple-collector inductively coupled mass spectrometry (MC-ICPMS). Zirconium is isolated from the rock matrix via a chromatographic separation protocol using a first pass column with AG1-X8 anion exchange resin, and a second pass column containing Eichrom (R) DGA resin. A Zr-91-Zr-96 double-spike was created from enriched single Zr-91 and Zr-96 isotope spikes. Samples were combined with the Zr double-spike at a 43: 57 spike: sample [Zr] ratio, prior to dissolution and column chemistry. After column chemistry the purified sample solutions were analysed on a Thermo Scientific Neptune Plus MC-ICPMS and the data was reduced using IsoSpike, with the final Zr isotope data being reported as the per mil deviation of the Zr-94/Zr-90 from the IPGP-Zr standard (delta Zr-94/90(IPGP-Zr)). The delta Zr-94/90(IPGP-Zr) of six igneous standard reference materials: two basalts (BHVO-2 and JB-2), one andesite (AGV-2), two granites (GA and GS-N) and a serpentinite (UB-N) as well as one individual zircon grain (Plesovice zircon), are presented using this method. Sample measurements are presented with an analytical uncertainty of +/- similar to 0.05% (2sd) for delta Zr-94/90(IPGP-Zr) and these rocks exhibit isotopic variations of similar to 0.15% for delta Zr-94/90(IPGP-Zr). These results demonstrate that natural variations of Zr isotopes occur within terrestrial igneous rocks, and are resolvable with this method. Finally the variation of delta Zr-94/90(IPGP-Zr) values observed within the magmatic rock reference materials is correlated (R-2 = 0.78; n = 5) with SiO2, suggesting that Zr isotopes could serve as a sensitive tracer of magmatic processes.","id":"10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.07.007"}

{"text":"International audience; Tektites are glasses derived from near-surface continental crustal rocks that were molten and ejected from the Earths surface during hypervelocity meteorite impacts. They are among the driest terrestrial samples, although the exact mechanism of water loss and the behaviour of other volatile species during these processes are debated. Based on the difference in magnitude of the Cu and Zn isotopic fractionations in tektites, and the difference of diffusivity between these elements, it was suggested that volatile loss was diffusion-limited. Tin is potentially well suited to testing this model, as it has a lower diffusivity in silicate melts than both Cu and Zn, but a similar volatility to Zn. Here, we analysed the Sn stable isotopic composition in a suite of seven tektites, representing three of the four known tektite strewn fields, and for which Zn and Cu isotopes were previously reported. Tin is enriched in the heavier isotopes (>= 2,5 parts per thousand on the Sn-122/Sn-118 ratio) in tektites, correlated with the degree of Sn elemental depletion in their respective samples as well as with Cu and Zn isotope ratios, implying a common control. While the isotope fractionation of Sn, Cu and Zn is a result of volatility, the magnitude of isotope fractionation is strongly moderated by their relative rates of diffusion in the molten tektite droplets. An Australasian Muong Nong-type tektite analysed has the least Sn depletion and Sn isotope fractionation, consistent with these samples being more proximal to the source and experiencing a shorter time at high temperatures","id":"10.1016/j.chemgeo.2019.119279"}

{"text":"Abstract   The presence of fluoride (F\u2212)-bearing compounds in volcanic ash fallout is recognised to pose significant environmental and health hazards. Nevertheless, understanding of the formation and composition of these compounds remains limited, or even inconsistent. This hampers full comprehension of the risks and impacts elicited by fluorine-rich ash emissions after an explosive eruption. The 2010 activity of Eyjafjallajokull volcano in Iceland was characterised by contrasted eruptive styles - phreatomagmatic and magmatic - which produced ash deposits with distinct soluble F\u2212 contents. Based on X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and leachate analyses of Eyjafjallajokull ash materials, we infer the existence of silicon hexafluoride salts, particularly Na2SiF6, dominantly if not exclusively on the magmatic ash, and suggest a reaction mechanism for their formation. The presence of Na2SiF6 explains the much greater F\u2212 concentration and higher acidity measured in leachates of the magmatic ash compared to those of the phreatomagmatic ash. River waters affected by ash deposition during the magmatic activity showed a temporary increase in F\u2212 and decrease in dissolved silicon isotope values (\u03b430Si). We contend that the formation of silicon hexafluoride salts on ash leads to a surface enrichment of the ash's silicate glass and mineral components in 28Si, with the release of this light Si from the magmatic ash during the early stage of weathering causing a depression in the riverine \u03b430Si. This supports existing evidence of silicate dissolution processes being influenced by the presence of fluorine. Our study also points to the likely important role of Na2SiF6 in modulating the environmental and health effects of ash emissions from fluorine-rich magmatic eruptions.","id":"10.1016/j.chemgeo.2021.120327"}

Overall, legume mulches appear more effective in dicotyledonous than in monocotyledonous weed control. Trifolium subterraneum cv. Antas and T. repens cv. Haifa were identified as the potentially most suitable legumes for use as pLM and their use in mixtures could be a promising solution. In addition, the ecotypes of Medicago polymorpha Manciano and Talamone proved to be well adapted for local environmental conditions and they showed a better weed suppression than the commercial cultivars of Medicago polymorpha. Weed control in organic conservative vegetable systems is extremely challenging and the use of legume permanent living mulches (pLM) presents an interesting opportunity. The successful use of pLM is largely determined by the choice of appropriate legumes which are able to combine adequate weed control with a marginal competitive effect on the cash crop(s). However, the availability of legumes for such systems is limited and their characterization based on growth traits can support the selection of suitable legumes for conservation organic vegetable systems.

{"text":"Abstract   In this study, we investigated the Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) protein affinity for manufactured metal oxide nanoparticles (NPs), respectively TiO2 and CeO2. Changes in the NPs surface charge property and resulting stability were investigated by considering pH-dependent electrostatic scenarios and contrasting solution conditions from ultra-pure water to more complex biological mixtures regarding the ionic and protein composition. After careful characterization of NPs and BSA as a function of pH, we used variable BSA concentrations to study the impact of BSA adsorption and we found that protein affinity for NPs was largely controlled by electrostatic interactions. We demonstrated that in ultra-pure water increasing gradually the BSA concentration results in aggregation when BSA and NPs charges are opposite (charge neutralization). On the other hand, when NPs were added in a solution containing BSA, aggregation was prevented due to corona formation. Then, the ultrapure water was replaced by Dulbecco\u2019s phosphate-buffered saline (DPBS) to mimic the blood composition and ionic strength. BSA was then replaced by fetal calf serum (FCS) to mimic the great variety of proteins and other biomolecules found in the blood. Our findings indicate that, in all cases, initially dispersed TiO2 or CeO2 NPs are stabilized by the presence of proteins and that protein adsorption is fast regarding NPs homoaggregation. Proteins are found to improve NPs dispersion even at high ionic strength with overarching consequences on the fate, transport and related risk of NPs in living systems.","id":"10.1016/j.colsurfa.2018.05.091"}

Given the persistence and increasing occurrence of TFA in the soil environment, accumulated TFA could impact soil properties and functions. Therefore, we investigated the effects of a wide range of concentrations of TFA (0.001\u2013100\u2009\u03bcg\u2009g<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>) on chemical, physical and biological indicators of soil health, using a six\u2010week microcosm experiment. Our results showed that TFA treatments decreased soil pH, sulphate content, soil respiration, litter decomposition and bacterial abundance, and increased phosphate content (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>\u00a0&lt;\u20090.05). These effects were observed for TFA concentrations \u22651\u2009\u03bcg\u2009g<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>. As expected, because of its strong acidity, TFA decreased soil pH, and this change likely contributed to effects on other soil parameters and functions, for example, reducing bacterial abundance and soluble nutrients. However, importantly, TFA clearly also affected soil parameters at concentrations at which soil pH was not changed. Soil aggregation, fungal abundance, and enzyme activities were not affected by TFA in this study. Considering the current reported environmental levels of TFA of &lt;2.4\u2009\u03bcg\u2009g<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>, only litter decomposition would be affected under current field conditions. Our data also show that future accumulation of higher concentrations, or hotspots of TFA, will likely negatively affect soils with similar properties as our test soil. Thus, we demonstrated that microbial processes can be impacted by the accumulation of the \u2018forever chemical\u2019 TFA in the tested sandy, low organic matter soil.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Highlights</jats:title><jats:p><jats:list list-type='bullet'> <jats:list-item><jats:p>Trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) decreased soil pH, respiration, litter decomposition and bacterial abundance.</jats:p></jats:list-item> <jats:list-item><jats:p>TFA affected soil soluble nutrients.</jats:p></jats:list-item> <jats:list-item><jats:p>TFA affected litter decomposition at 1\u2009\u03bcg\u2009g<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup> with no change in soil pH.</jats:p></jats:list-item> <jats:list-item><jats:p>Effects of TFA on soil enzyme activity and aggregation and fungal abundance were negligible.</jats:p></jats:list-item> </jats:list></jats:p></jats:sec>","id":"10.1111/ejss.13266"}

{"text":"Abstract   Smouldering peatland fires are capable of burning vast amounts of organic soils, resulting in the release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, as well as a significant deterioration of air quality causing in major regional crises known as haze events. Fundamental understanding of smouldering fire spread is essential for the development of mitigating technologies. In this paper, we have systematically conducted 63 experiments studying the individual and combined influence of two key factors affecting multidimensional smouldering spread in organic soils: moisture content (MC) and inorganic content (IC). Both lateral and in-depth smouldering spread were investigated using a novel shallow reactor. This shallow depth allows a greater number of experiments to be performed in a short period of time compared to deeper samples. Lateral spread was found to decrease linearly with moisture content (R2 > 90%); while in-depth spread rate increased linearly up to 300% from moisture content of 0% to 140%. Increased inorganic content linearly decreased the lateral spread rate but had little influence on in-depth spread in drier samples. Interestingly, in wetter samples, in-depth spread was in fact sensitive to inorganic content. A novel approach combining lateral and in-depth spread rates as vector components, revealed that the global spread is independent of moisture content, with an average spread rate of 8.7 and 8.4\u00a0cm/h for 2.5 and 40% IC, with changes in direction according to moisture content; going in-depth for wet soils, and laterally for dry soils. Similarly, increasing the IC encouraged downward spread for wet samples. We also report observations of a bifurcation of lateral spread, where spread would locally extinguish where the in-depth spread was greater than the lateral spread. These findings provide previously unknown insight into the relationship between lateral and in-depth spread in smouldering fires, ultimately improving the fundamental understanding of such fires.","id":"10.1016/j.combustflame.2019.11.001"}

{"text":"Abstract   Plant stress monitoring is of crucial importance to understand the plant response to environmental conditions, and has been widely applied in various fields including biology, agronomy, botany, and horticulture. A number of methods and instruments for plant stress monitoring have been proposed, most of which show significant disadvantages such as high cost, poor accuracy or complex operation that limit the use of such devices. In this paper, we propose a low cost, portable active multispectral optical device for precise plant stress detection and field mapping named Plant-O-Meter. The device has an integrated multispectral source that comprises light sources of the four most indicative wavelengths (850, 630, 535 and 465\u202fnm), and enables simultaneous illumination of the whole plant. Sequential illumination and detection provide rapid reflectance measurements, which are wirelessly transmitted to android operated devices for processing and data storing. The device was tested in laboratory conditions comparing the Plant-O-Meter measurements with the image results from a SPECIM hyperspectral camera and a GreenSeeker handheld device and under field conditions with the GreenSeeker. The comparison revealed comparable performance, showing strong correlation with both the hyperspectral (R2\u202f=\u202f0.997) and the GreenSeeker handheld (R2\u202f=\u202f0.954 from the laboratory measurements and R2\u202f=\u202f0.886 from the field experiments), indicating that the device exhibits strong potential for accurate plant stress measurements. Moreover, owing to the very simple operating principle, the device represents a compact, cost-effective, and easy-to-operate solution.","id":"10.1016/j.compag.2019.04.021"}

{"text":"Open AccessPeer reviewed The fraction of green canopy cover (CC) is an important feature commonly used to characterize crop growth and for calibration of crop and hydrological models. It is well accepted that there is a relation between CC and NDVI through linear or quadratic models, however a straight-forward empirical approach, to derive CC from NDVI observations, is still lacking. In this study, we conducted a meta-analysis of the NDVI-CC relationships with data collected from 19 different studies (N=1397). Generic models are proposed here for 13 different agricultural crops, and the associated degree of uncertainty, together with the magnitude of error were quantified for each model (RMSE around 6-18% of CC).We observed that correlations are adequate for the majority of crops as R2 values were above 75% for most cases, and coefficient estimates were significant for most of the linear and quadratic models. Extrapolation to conditions different than those found in the studies may require local validation, as obtained regressions are affected by non-sampling errors or sources of systematic error that need further investigation. In a case study with wheat, we tested the use of NDVI as a proxy to estimate CC and to calibrate the AquaCrop model. Simulation outcomes were validated with field data collected from three growing seasons and confirmed that the NDVI-CC relationship was useful for modelling research. We highlight that the overall applicability of these relationships to modelling is promising as the RMSE are in line with acceptable levels published in several sensitivity analyses.

{"text":"Open AccessZinc metal-silicate fractionation provides experimental access to the conditions of core formation and Zn has been used to estimate the S contents of the Earth's core and of the bulk Earth, assuming that they share similar volatility and that Zn was not partitioned into the Earth's core. We have conducted a suite of partitioning experiments to characterize Zn metal-silicate elemental and isotopic fractionation as a function of time, temperature, and composition. Experiments were conducted at temperatures from 1473-2273K, with run durations from 5-240 minutes for four starting materials. Chemical and isotopic equilibrium is achieved within 10 minutes. Zinc metal-silicate isotopic fractionation displays no resolvable dependence on temperature, composition, or oxygen fugacity. Thus, the Zn isotopic composition of silicate phases can be used as a proxy for bulk telluric bodies. Results from this study and literature data were used to parameterize Zn metal-silicate partitioning as a function of temperature, pressure, and redox state. Using this parameterization and viable formation conditions, we have estimated a range of Zn contents in the cores of iron meteorite parent bodies (i.e. iron meteorites) of ~0.1-150 ppm, in good agreement with natural observations. We have calculated the first geochemical estimates for the Zn contents of the Earth's core and of the bulk Earth, at 242 +/-107 ppm and 114 +/-34 ppm (respectively), that consider the slightly siderophile behavior of Zn and are therefore significantly higher than previous estimates. Assuming similar volatility for S and Zn, a chondritic S/Zn ratio, and considering our new estimates, we have calculated a geochemical upper bound for the S content of the Earth's core of 6.3 +/-1.9 wt%. This indicates that S may be a major contributor to the density deficit of the Earth's core or that the S/Zn ratio for the Earth is non-chondritic.

{"text":"Open AccessCarbonaceous chondrites (CCs) may have been the carriers of water, volatile and moderately volatile elements to Earth. Investigating the abundances of these elements, their relative volatility, and isotopes of state-change tracer elements such as Zn, and linking these observations to water contents, provide vital information on the processes that govern the abundances and isotopic signatures of these species in CCs and other planetary bodies. Here we report Zn isotopic data for 28 CCs (20 CM, 6 CR, 1 C2-ung, and 1 CV3), as well as trace element data for Zn, In, Sn, Tl, Pb, and Bi in 16 samples (8 CM, 6 CR, 1 C2-ung, and 1 CV3), that display a range of elemental abundances from case-normative to intensely depleted. We use these data, water content data from literature and Zn isotopes to investigate volatile depletions and to discern between closed and open system heating. Trace element data have been used to construct relative volatility scales among the elements for the CM and CR chondrites. From least volatile to most, the scale in CM chondrites is Pb-Sn-Bi-In-Zn-Tl, and for CR chondrites it is Tl-Zn-Sn-Pb-Bi-In. These observations suggest that heated CM and CR chondrites underwent volatile loss under different conditions to one another and to that of the solar nebula, e.g. differing oxygen fugacities. Furthermore, the most water and volatile depleted samples are highly enriched in the heavy isotopes of Zn. Taken together, these lines of evidence strongly indicate that heated CM and CR chondrites incurred open system heating, stripping them of water and volatiles concomitantly, during post-accretionary shock impact(s). 4 tables, 5 figures","id":"10.1016/j.gca.2017.09.027"}

ANR-10-LABX-0023 and ANR-11-IDEX-0005-02). Parts of this work were supported by IPGP multidisciplinary program PARI, and by Region \u00eele-de-France SESAME Grant (no. 12015908). High-precision double-spike Zr stable isotope measurements (expressed as \u03b494/90ZrIPGP-Zr, the permil deviation of the 94Zr/90Zr ratio from the IPGP-Zr standard) are presented for a range of ocean island basalts (OIB) and mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) to examine mass-dependent isotopic variations of zirconium in Earth. Ocean island basalts samples, spanning a range of radiogenic isotopic flavours (HIMU, EM) show a limited range in \u03b494/90ZrIPGP-Zr (0.046 \u00b1 0.037 \u2030; 2sd, n=13). Similarly, MORB samples with chondrite-normalized La/Sm of > 0.7 show a limited range in \u03b494/90ZrIPGP-Zr (0.053 \u00b1 0.040 \u2030; 2sd, n=8). In contrast, basaltic lavas from mantle sources that have undergone significant melt depletion, such as depleted normal MORB (N-MORB) show resolvable variations in \u03b494/90ZrIPGP-Zr, from -0.045 \u00b1 0.018 to 0.074 \u00b1 0.023 \u2030. Highly evolved igneous differentiates (>65 wt% SiO2) from Hekla volcano in Iceland are isotopically heavier than less evolved igneous rocks, up to 0.53 \u2030. These results suggest that both mantle melt depletion and extreme magmatic differentiation leads to resolvable mass-dependent Zr isotope fractionation. We find that this isotopic fractionation is most likely driven by incorporation of light isotopes of Zr within the 8-fold coordinated sites of zircons, driving residual melts, with a lower coordination chemistry, towards heavier values. Using a Rayleigh fractionation model, we suggest a \u03b1zircon-melt of 0.9995 based on the whole rock \u03b494/90ZrIPGP-Zr values of the samples from Hekla volcano (Iceland). Zirconium isotopic fractionation during melt-depletion of the mantle is less well-constrained, but may result from incongruent melting and incorporation of isotopically light Zr in the 8-fold coordinated M2 site of orthopyroxene. Based on these observations lavas originating from the effect of melt extraction from a depleted mantle source (N-MORB) or that underwent zircon saturation (SiO2 >65 wt%) are removed from the dataset to give an estimate of the primitive mantle Zr isotope composition of 0.048 \u00b1 0.032 \u2030; 2sd, n=48. These data show that major controls on Zr fractionation in the Earth result from partial melt extraction in the mantle and by zircon fractionation in differentiated melts. Conversely, fertile mantle is homogenous with respect to Zr isotopes. Zirconium mass-dependent fractionation effects can therefore be used to trace large-scale mantle melt depletion events and the effects of felsic crust formation.

{"text":"International audience; Although Solar System bodies exhibit large variations in their volatile element abundances, the mechanisms and conditions that lead to these variations remain ambiguous. The howardite-eucrite-diogenite (HED) meteorites that likely sample the asteroid 4 Vesta, provide evidence for extensive volatile depletion on their parent body. Isotopic variations in moderately volatile elements, such as Zn, have been used to track the origin of such volatile loss. Although not nominally volatile, Cr is useful because it has several oxidized gas species that render it volatile under the oxidizing conditions that characterize planetary accretion. As such, volatile loss of Cr has the potential to produce an isotopically light evaporation residue under an equilibrium regime. This contrasts with other moderately volatile elements that show heavy isotope enrichments in the residue following both kinetic or equilibrium fractionation. Here, we report the Cr stable isotope composition of 11 eucrites and four diogenites. The eucrites possess systematically lighter Cr isotope compositions than diogenites, which is onset by the accumulation of isotopically heavy Cr3+-rich orthopyroxene and spinel in diogenites during their magmatic evolution. We estimate for the primary eucrite melt with Mg# approximate to 50, a delta Cr-53 (Cr-53/Cr-52 deviation relative to NIST SRM 979 in per mile) of -0.22 +/- 0.03 parts per thousand (2SD), lighter than any chondritic meteorite group by similar to 0.1 parts per thousand This deficit may result from either partial melting with residual Cr3+-bearing phases (e.g. chromite) that retain heavy isotopes, or from vapor loss that occurred at equilibrium with a magma ocean on Vesta. Isotopic fractionation during partial melting would necessitate implausibly high Cr contents in the Vestan mantle, and oxygen fugacities high enough to stabilize chromite in the mantle source. Isotopic fractionation during evaporation would require an oxidized vapor and a reduced residue, as predicted by thermodynamic constraints on the composition of the vapor phase above a silicate magma ocean. Therefore, this Cr isotopic deficit between Vesta and chondrites may be caused by Cr loss at relatively high oxygen fugacity in a gas phase at equilibrium with the liquid from which it evolved. Temperatures of volatile loss are estimated to be lower than 2300 K, consistent with loss from a large-scale magma ocean model for formation of Vesta, which may be a common evolutionary stage in accreting planetesimals.

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience Climate change affects the Arctic and sub-Arctic regions by exposing previously frozen permafrost to thaw, unlocking soil nutrients, changing hydrological processes, and boosting plant growth. As a result, sub-Arctic tundra is subject to a shrub expansion, called 'shrubification', at the expense of sedge species. Depending on the intrinsic foliar properties of these plant species, changes in foliar mineral element fluxes with shrubification in the context of permafrost degradation may influence topsoil mineral element composition. Despite the potential implications of changes in topsoil mineral element concentrations for the fate of organic carbon, this remains poorly quantified. Here, we investigate vegetation foliar and topsoil mineral element composition (Si, K, Ca, P, Mn, Zn, Cu, Mo, V) across a natural gradient of permafrost degradation at a typical sub-Arctic tundra at Eight Mile Lake (Alaska, USA). Results show that foliar mineral element concentrations are higher (up to 9 times; Si, K, Mo for all species, and for some species Zn) or lower (up to 2 times; Ca, P, Mn, Cu, V for all species, and for some species Zn) in sedge than in shrub species. As a result, a vegetation shift over similar to 40 years has resulted in lower topsoil concentrations in Si, K, Zn, and Mo (respectively of 52, 24, 20, and 51%) in highly degraded permafrost sites compared to poorly degraded permafrost sites due to lower foliar fluxes of these elements. For other elements (Ca, P, Mn, Cu, and V), the vegetation shift has not induced a marked change in topsoil concentrations at this current stage of permafrost degradation. A modeled amplified shrubification associated with a further permafrost degradation is expected to increase foliar Ca, P, Mn, Cu, and V fluxes, which will likely change these element concentrations in topsoil. These data can serve as a first estimate to assess the influence of other shifts in vegetation in Arctic and sub-Arctic tundra such as sedge expansion under wetter soil conditions.","id":"10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.115915"}

{"text":"Open AccessPeer reviewed Soil health and function is one of the most important components for sustainable management of woody orchards. Intensive use of machinery and tillage creates heavy pressure on agroecosystems by altering the soil physicochemical and biological characteristics. In this study we aimed to assess the changes in soil physicochemical properties and the soil bacterial community structure, as well as the main drivers involved in shifts in the microbial community following 10 years implementing reduced tillage and reduced tillage plus green manure in a rainfed Mediterranean almond orchard. The treatments were: i) conventional tillage (CT); ii) reduced tillage (RT); and iii) reduced tillage and diversification with Avena sativa and Vicia sativa (RTD). After ten years, the results showed that the different managements had no significant effect on almond yields. RTD significantly increased total organic carbon (TOC), with an average content of 19.5 g kg\u22121 compared to 17.1 g kg\u22121 in CT. RTD also contributed to an increase in the fraction of soil macro-aggregates. Both RT and RTD significantly increased soil total nitrogen (NT) and particulate organic carbon (POC). However, other physical and chemical variables such as exchangeable Ca, Mg and K, bioavailable Fe, Cu, Zn and Mn, cation exchange capacity, bulk density, wilting point and field capacity were not significantly affected by the management. The bacterial community significantly changed with management: RTD showed a higher relative abundance of the family Solirubrobacteraceae and the genera Streptomyces and Solirubrobacter. The bacterial community structure was explained by changes in TOC, POC, pH, and NT values. Thus, a combination of reduced tillage and green manure could represent an appropriate sustainable management for rainfed almond orchards in very fragile environmental conditions, due to an increase in soil organic matter, total nitrogen, and the higher presence of beneficial bacteria related to soil productivity This work was supported by the European Commission Horizon 2020 project Diverfarming [grant agreement 728003].","id":"10.1016/j.geoderma.2022.116218"}

These findings support the need for on-site treatment of high-risk point sources of antibiotic resistance genes. 13 antibiotic resistance genes, Integrase Class 1 and 16S rRNA concentrations were quantified using multiplex quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assays and the presence and/or concentration of 711 antibiotics were analyzed. Hospital wastewater contained approximately 25% more antibiotics and gene concentrations between 0.4 log to 1.8-fold higher than communal wastewater (CWW). blaKPC and vanA could be identified as hospital-related genes and were reduced to under the limit of detection (LOD) during on-site treatment. Advanced on-site treatment removed between 0.5 and 3.6-fold more genes than conventional biological urban wastewater treatment (activated sludge). Advanced on-site treatment was able to eliminate 12 out of 19 detected antibiotics, while urban waste water treatment eliminated up to 1 (out of 21 detected). Different advanced treatment technologies were able to target different pollutants to varying extents, making sequential alignment more effective. MBR treatment was most efficient in antibiotic resistance gene reduction and ozonation in antibiotic reduction. blaKPC could only be detected in the influent of the urban wastewater treatment plant receiving untreated hospital wastewater. Similarly, vanA was only consistently detected in this treatment plant. These results indicate a positive effect of on-site treatment of hospital wastewater on the communal sewage system.","id":"10.1016/j.ijheh.2019.01.004"}

{"text":"<jats:p>Viola x wittrockiana L. is an ornamental plant in high demand in horticulture. It is becoming more critical for greenhouse growers to focus on sustainable production to enhance plant quality while reducing negative environmental impacts. Therefore, assessing the effect of recycled phosphorous (P) and nitrogen (N) sources on the growth of viola could become very useful for producers in terms of sustainability. This experiment analysed the optimal fertiliser composition to grow viola using recovered fertilisers in a greenhouse trial under controlled conditions. Well-rooted viola plugs were grown in a standard peat-based growing medium. Using recycled sources of P and N as struvite and potassium struvite, ammonium sulphate, and ammonium nitrate, 14 fertiliser blends were prepared, tested, and compared with the slow-release commercial fertiliser Osmocote. Plants treated with ammonium nitrate showed healthy growth and optimal plant N concentrations. In contrast, most blends using the recovered ammonium sulphate resulted in an unacceptable increase of ammonium concentrations in the growing medium. The combination of ammonium sulphate and potassium sulphate caused an increase in the electrical conductivity in the growing medium, negatively affecting plant growth. However, blend 13 containing struvite, ammonium sulphate and potassium struvite expressed the best chemical composition with non-significant differences in the biomass from the positive controls, as it reduced the amount of potassium sulphate needed. Our results indicate that fertiliser blends containing P as struvite, N as ammonium nitrate or reduced amount of ammonium sulphate, and K as potassium struvite can substitute the use of mineral fertiliser blends to grow ornamental plant species as viola.</jats:p>","id":"10.3390/agronomy12010182"}

{"text":"Open AccessGraphical abstract The paper aims at optimising and validating possible routes toward the full valorisation of grape agrowaste to produce bioactive molecules and new materials. Starting from Merlot red pomace, phenol complex mixtures were successfully extracted by using two different approaches. Extracts obtained by solvent-based (SE) technique contained up to 46.9 gGAeq/kgDW of total phenols. Depending on the used solvent, the prevalence of compounds belonging to different phenol families was achieved. Pressurized liquid extraction (PLE) gave higher total phenol yields (up to 79 gGAeq/kgDW) but a lower range of extracted compounds. All liquid extracts exerted strong antioxidant properties. Moreover, both SE and PLE extraction solid residues were directly exploited (between 5 and 20% w/w) to prepare biocomposite materials by direct mixing via an eco-friendly approach with PHBV polymer. The final composites showed mechanical characteristics similar to PHVB matrix. The use of pomace residues in biocomposites could therefore bring both to the reduction of the cost of the final material, as a lower amount of costly PHBV is used. The present research demonstrated the full valorisation of grape pomace, an agrowaste produced every year in large amounts and having a significant environmental impact.","id":"10.1016/j.jare.2020.02.015"}

{"text":"<jats:p>This study aims to investigate the effects of an optimized sowing calendar for wheat over a surface irrigation scheme in the semi-arid region of Haouz (Morocco) on irrigation water requirements, crop growth and development and on yield. For that, a scenario-based simulation approach based on the covariance matrix adaptation\u2013evolution strategy (CMA-ES) was proposed to optimize both the spatiotemporal distribution of sowing dates and the irrigation schedules, and then evaluate wheat crop using the 2011\u20132012 growing season dataset. Six sowing scenarios were simulated and compared to identify the most optimal spatiotemporal sowing calendar. The obtained results showed that with reference to the existing sowing patterns, early sowing of wheat leads to higher yields compared to late sowing (from 7.40 to 5.32 t/ha). Compared with actual conditions in the study area, the spatial heterogeneity is highly reduced, which increased equity between farmers. The results also showed that the proportion of plots irrigated in time can be increased (from 40% to 82%) compared to both the actual irrigation schedules and to previous results of irrigation optimization, which did not take into consideration sowing dates optimization. Furthermore, considerable reduction of more than 40% of applied irrigation water can be achieved by optimizing sowing dates. Thus, the proposed approach in this study is relevant for irrigation managers and farmers since it provides an insight on the consequences of their agricultural practices regarding the wheat sowing calendar and irrigation scheduling and can be implemented to recommend the best practices to adopt.</jats:p>","id":"10.3390/rs13183789"}

{"text":"The mechanical impedance of soils inhibits the growth of plant roots, often being the most significant physical limitation to root system development. Non-invasive imaging techniques have recently been used to investigate the development of root system architecture over time, but the relationship with soil deformation is usually neglected. Correlative mapping approaches parameterised using 2D and 3D image data have recently gained prominence for quantifying physical deformation in composite materials including fibre-reinforced polymers and trabecular bone. Digital Image Correlation (DIC) and Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) are computational techniques which use the inherent material texture of surfaces and volumes, captured using imaging techniques, to map full-field deformation components in samples during physical loading.<br/><br/>Here we develop an experimental assay and methodology for four-dimensional, in vivo X-ray Computed Tomography (XCT) and apply a Digital Volume Correlation (DVC) approach to the data to quantify deformation. The method is validated for a field-derived soil under conditions of uniaxial compression, and a calibration study is used to quantify thresholds of displacement and strain measurement. The validated and calibrated approach is then demonstrated for an in vivo test case in which an extending maize root in field-derived soil was imaged hourly using XCT over a growth period of 19 h. This allowed full-field soil deformation data and 3D root tip dynamics to be quantified in parallel for the first time.<br/><br/>This method paves the way for comparative studies of contrasting soils and plant genotypes, improving our understanding of the fundamental mechanical processes which influence root system development.","id":"10.1016/j.jbiomech.2016.04.023"}

{"text":"Abstract   The development of mobile systems for the decentralized pelletizing of forest-based residual biomass is currently underway. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the environmental impacts of such systems that needs to be developed for correct judgements on the most sustainable developing paths. The objective of this study was to quantify and compare the environmental impacts of a decentralized mobile production system for pelletizing logging residues in Northern Sweden operating at either the forest landing or forest terminal from a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) perspective.  The results showed that the landing- and terminal-based scenarios showed similar environmental profiles. The pelleting, transportation and drying stages of both scenarios were identified as environmental hotspots. These production stages accounted for 62%, 14% and 14% of the total greenhouse gas emissions, respectively. Key factors influencing the system were the use of electricity at terminals, the increase in pelletizer capacity, and long transportation distances. The use of a Swedish electricity mix instead of diesel based electricity in the terminal-based scenario reduced all of the environmental impacts by between 68% and 83%, with the exception of fresh water eutrophication potential, which increased by 26%.  In conclusion, our findings indicate that an electrified mobile pellet production system with high operational efficiency and situated at a terminal close to the harvesting sites could, from an LCA point of view, be an interesting option for pelletizing Nordic logging residues, especially in regions with long transportation distances to industry.","id":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2018.08.030"}

{"text":"Open AccessOver semi-arid agricultural areas, the surface energy balance and its components are largely dependent on the soil water availability. In such conditions, the land surface temperature (LST) retrieved from the thermal bands has been commonly used to represent the high spatial variability of the surface evaporative fraction and associated fluxes. In contrast, however, the soil moisture (SM) retrieved from microwave data has rarely been used thus far due to the unavailability of high-resolution (field scale) SM products until recent times. Soil evaporation is controlled by the surface SM. Moreover, the surface SM dynamics is temporally related to root zone SM, which provides information about the water status of plants. The aim of this work was to assess the gain in terms of flux estimates when integrating microwave-derived SM data in a thermal-based energy balance model at the field scale. In this study, SM products were derived from three different methodologies: the first approach inverts SM, labeled hereafter as \u2018SMO20\u2019, from the backscattering coefficient and the interferometric coherence derived from Sentinel-1 products in the water cloud model (WCM); the second approach inverts SM from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 data based on machine learning algorithms trained on a synthetic dataset simulated by the WCM noted \u2018SME16\u2019; and the third approach disaggregates the soil moisture active and passive SM at 100 m resolution using Landsat optical/thermal data \u2018SMO19\u2019. These SM products, combined with the Landsat based vegetation index and LST, are integrated simultaneously within an energy balance model (TSEB-SM) to predict the latent (LE) and sensible (H) heat fluxes over two irrigated and rainfed wheat crop sites located in the Haouz Plain in the center of Morocco. H and LE were measured over each site using an eddy covariance system and their values were used to evaluate the potential of TSEB-SM against the classical two source energy balance (TSEB) model solely based on optical/thermal data. Globally, TSEB systematically overestimates LE (mean bias of 100 W/m2) and underestimates H (mean bias of \u2212110 W/m2), while TSEB-SM significantly reduces those biases, regardless of the SM product used as input. This is linked to the parameterization of the Priestley Taylor coefficient, which is set to \u03b1PT = 1.26 by default in TSEB and adjusted across the season in TSEB-SM. The best performance of TSEB-SM was obtained over the irrigated field using the three retrieved SM products with a mean R2 of 0.72 and 0.92, and a mean RMSE of 31 and 36 W/m2 for LE and H, respectively. This opens up perspectives for applying the TSEB-SM model over extended irrigated agricultural areas to better predict the crop water needs at the field scale.

{"text":"Open AccessSeveral solutions are today proposed to farmers to minimize ammonia (NH3) emissions during storage. In the present study, special attention was given to slurry acidification and slurry crust enhancement and our objective was to assess the effect of slurry bio-acidification using sugar and cheese whey as an alternative to sulphuric acid, and the potential of rice bran as crust enhancer on NH3 and greenhouse gases emissions during storage. Both the cheese whey and the rice bran are materials, available in large amounts, with low commercial value in some EU regions as Portugal and its use, at farm scale, will be a win-win situation. Sugar is also a good alternative to acid attending its relatively low value. A laboratory experiment was performed for 2 months with five treatments: non-treated cattle slurry (CTRL), slurry treated with sulphuric acid (ACID), slurry treated with sugar (SUGAR), slurry treated with cheese whey (WHEY) and rice bran applied on the slurry surface (RICE). The SUGAR treatment led to a reduction of NH3 emissions by 45% relative to CTRL while WHEY and RICE resulted in a reduction of 68% and 25%, respectively. Nevertheless, this effect of SUGAR and WHEY was shorter than in ACID, since NH3 emissions started to be observed in those 2 treatments after 31 and 35 days of storage, respectively. Nitrous oxide emissions remained close to zero in ACID and SUGAR. RICE led to the highest emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) releasing almost 5% of carbon present in the initial mixture (slurry \u00fe rice bran) and presented the highest methane emissions.

{"text":"Abstract   Bioelectrochemical systems have gained great interest as a viable wastewater treatment and energy recovery technology. How to achieve the efficient interfacial electron transfer from microbes to the electrode and reduce the cost are challenges of bioelectrochemical systems. This study demonstrated that the goose feather-derived N-doped activated carbon could be adopted as the effective anode modifier to improve the bioanode performance of bioelectrochemical systems. Various electrochemical characterizations showed that both the electrochemical activity and electron transfer efficiency of the electrodes were improved after modification with the goose feather-derived N-doped activated carbon. By using Shewanella oneidensis MR-1 inoculated bioelectrochemical systems with the goose feather-derived N-doped activated carbon-modified anode, a current density of 0.96\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.03 A/m2 was achieved, which was about 2 times higher than that without modification. Further analysis revealed a simultaneous enhancement of direct and flavins-mediated extracellular electron transfer after the modification with the goose feather-derived N-doped activated carbon. This enhanced extracellular electron transfer could be not only attributed to the intense interaction between cytochromes OmcA/MtrC and the goose feather-derived N-doped activated carbon, but also due to the improved flavins redox reaction on the goose feather-derived N-doped activated carbon-modified anode surface. This study broadens the recipe of bioanode of BESs via rational use of natural solid waste materials.","id":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2020.122012"}

{"text":"Open Accessinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion In a context of climate change and circular economy, it is fundamental to produce animal manure-based fertilizers attractive to farmers who are reluctant to use heterogeneous materials, poorly characterized and with unbalanced nutrient contents, namely N:P ratios different from plant requirements. Hence, the aim of the present study was to assess the potential of different treated and non-treated animal manures to produce tailor-made manure-based fertilizers with known N:P ratios. Seven manures were considered: cattle, caprine and poultry solid manures, two contrasting cattle slurries and two contrasting swine slurries. Slurries were further treated by solid-liquid separation, acidification, and acidification followed by solid-liquid separation. Raw and treated manures were fully characterized to assess the effect of manure type and treatment on their nutrient contents and N:P ratios, to incorporate them in manure-based fertilizers with selected N:P ratio. The present results were essential to support the manure-based fertilizer production and identify which materials could be considered: it appears clearly that the pig slurry with all stages of production and the correspondent liquid fraction cannot be used due to their low nutrients content. It was shown that the solid fractions rich in P and with a NT:N\u2013NH4+ ratio close to 1 are an excellent material to prepare manure-based fertilizers. Acidification, combined with solidliquid separation, produced a liquid fraction rich in both N and P and with a NT:PT ratio close to 1, with the additional benefit of a slow N-release material. Some of the manures or sub-products obtained after treatment provided the usual N:P ratio required by farmers and could be used directly as substitutes of mineral fertilizers. Nevertheless, the blending of some of these materials has a stronger potential to the production of specific manure-based fertilizer","id":"10.1016/j.jclepro.2022.130369"}

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience Contamination of groundwater resources by an immiscible organic phase commonly called NAPL (Non Aqueous Phase Liquid) represents a major scientific challenge considering the residence time of such a pollutant. This contamination leads to the formation of NAPL blobs trapped in the soil and impact of this residual saturation cannot be ignored for correct predictions of the contaminant fate. In this paper, we present results of micromodel experiments on the dissolution of pure hydrocarbon phase (toluene). They were conducted for two values of the P\u00e9clet number. These experiments provide data for comparison and validation of a two-phase non-equilibrium theoretical model developped by Quintard and Whitaker (1994) using the volume averaging method. The model was directly upscaled from the averaged pore-scale mass balance equations. The effective properties of the macroscopic model were calculated over periodic unit cells designed from images of the experimental flow cell. Comparison of experimental and numerical results shows that the transport model predicts correctly-with no fitting parameters-the main mechanisms of NAPL mass transfer. The study highlights the crucial need of having a fair recovery of pore-scale characteristic lengths to predict the mass transfer coefficient with accuracy.","id":"10.1016/j.jconhyd.2018.03.004"}

{"text":"Universidad Nacional Agraria La Molina. Facultad de Industrias Alimentarias Recent studies are increasingly focusing on quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa) as a high-quality protein-rich food source and, in general, on seed quality. This latter is a complex trait difcult to characterize with standard measurements or analyses. X-ray micro-CT allows to visualise the internal structure of small objects and has been already used in seed research, mostly for maize kernel characterization. To date this technique has not yet been applied to study quinoa seeds, despite the increasing interest for their nutritional properties. The aim of this work was to explore the use of X-ray icrotomography to provide new traits improving the seed phenotyping of quinoa. Two di\ufb00erent scanning approaches have been compared: one based on the simultaneous scanning of multiple seeds (30) at lower resolution (20 \u03bcm voxel size) and one based on the scanning of a single seed at higher resolution (2 \u03bcm voxel size). Such approaches were tested on a study case consisting of four di\ufb00erent quinoa genotypes.

{"text":"In intensive agriculture, N supply often exceeds crop requirements, even in nitrate vulnerable zones (NVZ). In farmland, the N surplus gives rise to NO3\u2212 leaching and consequent groundwater pollution. The present study aimed at proposing measures to reduce N leaching and hence improve N efficiency in a buffalo livestock farm located in the NVZ of Latina plain (Central Italy). The farm was cultivated with forage crops in a double annual crop rotation: Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) in winter and silage corn (Zea mays L.) in summer. Mineral and organic fertilizers were supplied to both crops. The annual N budget and soil solution NO3-N concentrations were evaluated using a modeling approach. The performance of the WinEPIC model in simulating the response of the NO3-N concentration in percolation to the N application rate was assessed and validated by field measurements of the NO3-N concentration in the soil solution. Three scenarios were proposed to identify the best practice to minimize the environmental impact of N application without significant yield loss. Also, recommendations of best practices in N fertilization and animal manure spreading were given. This study thus provides useful preliminary information for decision-making in agriculture/environmental policies.","id":"10.3390/agronomy6020023"}

Amajor challenge of the Sustainable Development Goals linked to Agriculture, Food Security, and Nutrition, under the current global crop production paradigm, is that increasing crop yields often have negative environmental impacts. It is therefore urgent to develop and adopt optimal soil-improving cropping systems (SICS) that can allow us to decouple these system parameters. Soil salinization is a major environmental hazard that limits agricultural potential and is closely linked to agricultural mismanagement and water resources overexploitation, especially in arid climates. Here we review literature seeking to ameliorate the negative e ect of soil salinization on crop productivity and conduct a global meta-analysis of 128 paired soil quality and yield observations from 30 studies. In this regard, we compared the e ectivity of di erent SICS that aim to cope with soil salinization across 11 countries, in order to reveal those that are the most promising. The analysis shows that besides case-specific optimization of irrigation and drainage management, combinations of soil amendments, conditioners, and residue management can contribute to significant reductions of soil salinity while significantly increasing crop yields. These results highlight that conservation agriculture can also achieve the higher yields required for upscaling and sustaining crop production.","id":"10.3390/agronomy9060295"}

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience This paper introduces a modified version of the DisPATCh (Disaggregation based on Physical And Theoretical scale Change) algorithm to disaggregate an SMAP surface soil moisture (SSM) product at a 20 m spatial resolution, through the use of sharpened Sentinel-3 land surface temperature (LST) data. Using sharpened LST as a high resolution proxy of SSM is a novel approach that needs to be validated and can be employed in a variety of applications that currently lack in a product with a similar high spatio-temporal resolution. The proposed high resolution SSM product was validated against available in situ data for two different fields, and it was also compared with two coarser DisPATCh products produced, disaggregating SMAP through the use of an LST at 1 km from Sentinel-3 and MODIS. From the correlation between in situ data and disaggregated SSM products, a general improvement was found in terms of Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient (R) for the proposed high resolution product with respect to the two products at 1 km. For the first field analyzed, R was equal to 0.47 when considering the 20 m product, an improvement compared to the 0.28 and 0.39 for the 1 km products. The improvement was especially noticeable during the summer season, in which it was only possible to successfully capture field-specific irrigation practices at the 20 m resolution. For the second field, R was 0.31 for the 20 m product, also an improvement compared to the 0.21 and 0.23 for the 1 km product. Additionally, the new product was able to depict SSM spatial variability at a sub-field scale and a validation analysis is also proposed at this scale. The main advantage of the proposed product is its very high spatio-temporal resolution, which opens up new opportunities to apply remotely sensed SSM data in disciplines that require fine spatial scales, such as agriculture and water management.","id":"10.3390/rs14010167"}

{"text":"Before the invention of modern, large-scale engineering projects, terrace systems were rarely built in single phases of construction, but instead developed gradually, and could even be said to have evolved. Understanding this process of landscape change is therefore important in order to fully appreciate how terrace systems were built and functioned, and is also pivotal to understanding how the communities that farmed these systems responded to changes; whether these are changes to the landscape brought about by the farming practices themselves, or changes to social, economic or climatic conditions. Combining archaeological stratigraphy, soil micromorphology and geochemistry, this paper presents a case-study from the historic and extensive terraced landscape at Konso, southwest Ethiopia, and demonstrates e in one important river valley at least e that the original topsoil and much of the subsoil was lost prior to the construction of hillside terraces. Moreover, the study shows that alluvial sediment traps that were built adjacent to rivers relied on widespread hillside soil erosion for their construction, and strongly suggests that these irrigated riverside fields were formerly a higher economic priority than the hillside terraces themselves; a possibility that was not recognised by numerous observational studies of farming in this landscape. Research that takes into account how terrace systems change through time can thus provide important details of whether the function of the system has changed, and can help assess how the legacies of former practices impact current or future cultivation.","id":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2017.01.036"}

{"text":"<jats:p>Analysis of consumer preferences and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for sustainable foods produced using new agri-food technologies is required to enhance the uptake of innovations that accelerate the transition towards sustainable food systems. Consumers\u2019 willingness to buy new food products, with no or limited consumption experience, mainly depends on their food choice motivational orientations (promotion- vs prevention-orientation). The objective of this study was to elicit consumers\u2019 WTP for foods that are produced with microbial applications during the plant production phase with the aim to reduce the use of synthetic chemicals in crop farming, as well as to understand the associations of food choice motives, personal and socio-demographic factors with the WTP. We used contingent valuation to elicit consumers\u2019 WTP for three food products (wheat bread, consumer potatoes and tomato sauce) through online surveys. Data were collected from 291 consumers, primarily from Italy, Germany and the Netherlands. Descriptive statistics, latent variable modelling and logistic regression were used to analysis data. Results show that more than two-third of the respondents are willing to pay premiums of at least 0.11 euro per kg of food products for reductions in synthetic chemical use by at least 50% due to microbial applications. The amount of WTP increases with the level of reductions in synthetic chemical use. The majority of the respondents are promotion-oriented consumers in relation to their food involvement, and are more likely to pay premiums for the sustainably produced food products. Environmentally concerned consumers are also more likely to pay premiums, whereas health concerned consumers are not. This study contributes to understanding of consumers\u2019 attitude and perceived health risks towards foods obtained using microbial applications, and the heterogeneity of their preferences. Results provide insights for identifying potential buyers of foods produced using microbial applications, and to set prices according to the levels of consumers\u2019 WTP.</jats:p>","id":"10.1371/journal.pone.0260488"}

{"text":"Mineral elements play a crucial role for organic carbon stabilization, which is key for organic carbon mineralization rates in soils. With thawing permafrost, especially in ice-rich regions such as the Yedoma domain, vast amounts of organic carbon previously stored in deep frozen deposits are unlocked and therefore available to undergo microbial mineralization leading to potential carbon dioxide and methane emissions. Mineral elements interfere with organic carbon degradation through various processes: i) mineral protection (aggregation, adsorption, and complexation) stabilizes organic carbon and mitigates its mineralization, and ii) change in mineral nutrients availability affects microorganisms growth and metabolic activity. Despite huge efforts to assess organic carbon stocks and lability in permafrost regions, there is a lack of studies on the mineral component assessment, which we aim to close with this dataset. Here, we provide a large-scale Yedoma domain Mineral Concentrations Assessment (YMCA) dataset of never thawed (since deposition) ice-rich Yedoma permafrost and previously thawed and partly refrozen Alas deposits. We used a portable X-ray fluorescence device (pXRF) for Si, Al, Fe, Ca, K, Ti, Mn, Zn, Sr and Zr concentration measurements on 1,292 sediment samples. Portable XRF measured concentrations trueness was calibrated using standard alkaline fusion and ICP-OES measurement from a subset of 144 samples (R\u00b2 from 0.725 to 0.996). This methodology lead to the creation of the Yedoma domain Mineral Concentration Assessment (YMCA) dataset, a necessary step to estimate mineral element stocks in never thawed Yedoma and previously thawed Alas deposits. Practically, the YMCA dataset is organized as follow: (i) all site and sample properties: sample ID, type of deposit, site location, profile ID, GPS coordinates, country, lithology, unconsolidated sediment type, geological epoch, samples depth below surface level (b.s.l) or height above sea/river level (a.s.l), sediment characteristics, bulk density, gravimetric and absolute ice content, total organic carbon content; (ii) the Si, Al, Fe, Ca, K, Ti, Mn, Zn, Sr and Zr concentrations (corrected based on linear regressions) in Yedoma and Alas deposits (n=1292).","id":"10.1594/pangaea.922724"}

{"text":"Megathrust earthquake sequences can impact buildings and infrastructure due to not only the mainshock but also the triggered aftershocks along the subduction interface and in the overriding crust. To give realistic ranges of aftershock simulations in regions with limited data and to provide time\u2010dependent seismic hazard information right after a future giant shock, we assess the variability of the epidemic\u2010type aftershock sequence (ETAS) model parameters in subduction zones that have experienced\u00a0M\u22657.5M\u22657.5\u00a0earthquakes, comparing estimates from long time windows with those from individual sequences. Our results show that the ETAS parameters are more robust if estimated from a long catalog than from individual sequences, given individual sequences have fewer data including missing early aftershocks. Considering known biases of the parameters (due to model formulation, the isotropic spatial aftershock distribution, and finite size effects of catalogs), we conclude that the variability of the ETAS parameters that we observe from robust estimates is not significant, neither across different subduction\u2010zone regions nor as a function of maximum observed magnitudes. We also find that ETAS parameters do not change when multiple\u00a0MM\u00a08.0\u20139.0 events are included in a region, mainly because an\u00a0MM\u00a09.0 sequence dominates the number of events in the catalog. Based on the ETAS parameter estimates in the long time period window, we propose a set of ETAS parameters for future\u00a0MM\u00a09.0 sequences for aftershock hazard assessment (\u2060K0=0.04\u00b10.02K0=0.04\u00b10.02\u2060,\u00a0\u03b1=2.3\u03b1=2.3\u2060,\u00a0c=0.03\u00b10.01c=0.03\u00b10.01\u2060,\u00a0p=1.21\u00b10.08p=1.21\u00b10.08\u2060,\u00a0\u03b3=1.61\u00b10.29\u03b3=1.61\u00b10.29\u2060,\u00a0d=23.48\u00b118.17d=23.48\u00b118.17\u2060, and\u00a0q=1.68\u00b10.55q=1.68\u00b10.55\u2060).

{"text":"Abstract   Shrub encroachment influences several ecosystem services in drylands worldwide. Yet, commonly used strategies to reduce encroachment show a low medium-term success, calling for a better understanding of its causes. Previous works identified multiple drivers responsible for this phenomenon, including anthropogenic and environmental causes. However, the relative effect of climate, topography and edaphic factors on shrub encroachment is not fully understood nor has been properly quantified in Mediterranean Basin drylands. Also, understanding how these drivers lead to changes in plant communities' functional traits associated to shrub encroachment is crucial, considering traits influence ecosystem processes and associated ecosystem services. Here, we studied the understory of a Mediterranean dryland ecosystem composed of savanna-like Holm-oak woodlands, along a regional climatic gradient. We specifically assessed (i) how climatic, topographic and edaphic factors influence understory relative shrub cover (RSC) and (ii) their direct and indirect effects (via RSC) on plant functional traits. We studied the mean and diversity of 12 functional traits related to plant regeneration, establishment, and dispersal, at the community-level. We found that, under similar low-intensity land use, topographic and edaphic factors, namely slope variations and soil C:N ratio, were the most important predictors of shrub encroachment, determining communities' functional characteristics. Climate, namely summer precipitation, had a much lesser influence. Our model explained 52% of the variation in relative shrub cover. Climate had a stronger effect on a set of functional traits weakly involved in shrub encroachment, related to flowering and dispersal strategies. We show that shrub encroachment is largely predicted by topo-edaphic factors in Mediterranean drylands subject to conventional low-intensity land use. Hence, management strategies to reduce encroachment need to take these drivers into account for efficient forecasting and higher cost-effectiveness. Our results suggest that climate change might not greatly impact shrub encroachment in the Mediterranean Basin, but may affect functional structure and reduce functional diversity of plant communities, thus affecting ecosystem functioning.","id":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.11.475"}

{"text":"Given the lack of satisfying treatments for consolidating marble affected by thermally induced grain detachment (the so-called 'sugaring'), the use of aqueous solutions of diammonium hydrogen phosphate (DAP) has recently been proposed. The idea is to form a new binding mineral (hydroxyapatite, HAP) as the reaction product between the DAP solution and the calcitic substrate. In this study, we investigated the effects of adding small quantities of ethanol (EtOH) to the DAP solution, with the aim of favoring HAP formation. The results of the study indicate that, when a 0.1 M DAP and 0.1 mM CaCl2 solution in 10 vol% EtOH is used, complete coverage of marble surface with a crack-free coating with reduced porosity is achieved (whereas no coating is formed without EtOH addition). This is thought to be a consequence of the weakening of hydration shells of phosphate ions in the DAP solution, thanks to the presence of ethanol molecules. When used to restore mechanical properties of weathered marble, the treatment with 10 vol% EtOH was found to significantly improve the dynamic elastic modulus after a single application and to completely restore it after a second application.","id":"10.1557/adv.2017.45"}

Long-term organic farming aims to reduce synthetic fertilizer and pesticide use in order to sustainably produce and improve soil quality. To do this, there is a need for more information about the soil microbial community, which plays a key role in a sustainable agriculture. In this paper, we assessed the long-term effects of two organic and one conventional cropping systems on the soil microbial community structure using high-throughput sequencing analysis, as well as the link between these communities and the changes in the soil properties and crop yield. The results showed that the crop yield was similar among the three cropping systems. The microbial community changed according to cropping system. Organic cultivation with manure compost and compost tea (Org_C) showed a change in the bacterial community associated with an improved soil carbon and nutrient content. A linear discriminant analysis effect size showed different bacteria and fungi as key microorganisms for each of the three different cropping systems, for conventional systems (Conv), different microorganisms such as Nesterenkonia, Galbibacter, Gramella, Limnobacter, Pseudoalteromonas, Pantoe, and Sporobolomyces were associated with pesticides, while for Org_C and organic cultivation with manure (Org_M), other types of microorganisms were associated with organic amendments with different functions, which, in some cases, reduce soil borne pathogens. However, further investigations such as functional approaches or network analyses are need to better understand the mechanisms behind this behavior.","id":"10.3390/agriculture11050445"}

{"text":"International audience; Digestate is an organic by-product of biogas production via anaerobic digestion processes and has a great potential as soil fertilizer due to concentrated nutrients. In this study, we examined digestate as a potential nutrient and microbial seeding for bioremediation of weathered (aged) petroleum hydrocarbon contaminated soils. We analysed 6 different treatments in microcosm using two industrial soils having different textures: a clay rich soil and a sandy soil. After 30 days of incubation, the highest total petroleum hydrocarbons (TPH) removal was observed in microcosms containing digestate together with bulking agent (17.8% and 12.7% higher than control in clay rich soil and sandy soil, respectively) or digestate together with immobilized bacteria (13.4% and 9% higher than control in clay rich soil and sandy soil, respectively). After digestate application microbial respiration was enhanced in sandy soil and inhibited in clay rich soil due to aggregates formation. After bulking agent addition to clay rich soil aggregates size was reduced and oxygen uptake was improved. Application of digestate to soil resulted in the development of distinct microbial groups in amended and non-amended soils. Genera containing species able to degrade TPH like Acinetobacter and Mycobacterium were abundant in digestate and in soil amended with digestate. Quantification of alkB genes, encoding alkane monoxygenase, revealed high concentration of these genes in digestate bacterial community. After application of digestate, the level of alkB genes significantly increased in soils and remained high until the end of the treatment. The study revealed great potential of digestate as a nutrient and bacteria source for soil bioremediation.","id":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.03.176"}

{"text":"Abstract   Awareness concerning sustainable groundwater consumption under the context of land use and climate change is gaining traction, raising the bar for adequate understanding of the complexities of natural and anthropogenic processes and how they affect groundwater quality. The heterogeneous characteristics of aquifers have hampered comprehensive source, transport and contaminant identification. As questions remain about the behavior and prediction of well-known groundwater contaminants, new concerns around emerging contaminants are on the increase. This review highlights some of the key contaminants that originate from anthropogenic activities, organized based on land use categories namely agricultural, urban and industrial. It further highlights the extensive overlap, in terms of both provenance as well as contaminant type, between the different land use sectors. A selection of case studies from literature that describe the continued concern of established contaminants, as well as new and emerging compounds, are presented to illustrate the many qualitative threats to global groundwater resources. In some cases, the risk of groundwater contamination lacks adequate gravity, while in others the underlying physical and societal processes are not fully understood and activities may commence without adequately considering potential impacts. In the agricultural context, the historic and current application of fertilizers and plant protectants, use of veterinary pharmaceuticals and hormones, strives to safeguard the growing food demands. In the context of a sprawling urban environment, waste, human pharmaceuticals, and urban pesticide outputs are increasing, with adequate runoff and sanitation infrastructure often lagging. Finally, industrial activities are associated with accidental leaks and spills, while the large-scale storage of industrial byproducts has led to legacy contaminants such as those stemming from raw mineral extraction. With this review paper, we aim to underscore the need for transdisciplinary research, along with transboundary communication, using sound science and adaptive policy and management practice in order to procure sustainable groundwater quality.","id":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2019.05.236"}

{"text":"The appropriateness of using treated wastewater for crop or agricultural irrigation remains a bone of contention among experts and policymakers. Here, we outline and analyze not only the benefits but also the drawbacks of such a practice in order to suggest a way forward. To ensure that our review reflects the state-of-the-art in terms of technological advances and best practices, only literature published in the last decade is considered except for literature on the history of reuse. The review begins by highlighting growing water scarcity, the history of wastewater reuse in agriculture, and the limitations of existing studies. A short overview of the approach used in the write-up is outlined after the introduction. It then proceeds with an in-depth look at three broad areas: environmental impacts, public health impacts, and economic impacts. In terms of environmental impacts, effects on soil quality, water resources, plant growth, and soil microbial communities are analyzed. For each sub-area, the positive effects are described before the negative ones. The same approach is then applied to public health impacts, the focus of which is on human exposure to heavy metals and pathogens, and economic impacts, which are assessed with particular reference to investment cost, financial benefit to wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), farm expenditure and income. Having weighed the advantages and disadvantages in each area, innovative measures are proposed for optimizing the benefits and mitigating the drawbacks of using treated wastewater for crop irrigation. Special consideration was given to contaminants of emerging concern and the known or perceived environmental and health risks associated with these contaminants.","id":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2020.144026"}

{"text":"The alteration of rare earth elements (REEs) biogeochemical cycles has increased the potential effects related to their environmental exposure in a one-health perspective. Cerium (Ce), gadolinium (Gd), lanthanum (La), and neodymium (Nd) are frequently related to technological applications and their environmental concentrations are already in the \u03bcg/kg \u2013 mg/kg (i.e., or L) range depending on the considered matrices. The effect of Ce, Gd, La, and Nd was investigated in a simulated AMD (0.01\u201310.22 mg/L) at pH 4 and 6 considering a battery of photosynthetic organisms (Raphidocelis subcapitata, Lepidium sativum, and Vicia faba) according to a multiple-endpoint approach (growth inhibition, germination index, and mutagenicity). According to modelled chemical speciation, the considered elements were mostly in the trivalent free form (86\u201388%) at pH 4. Gd, La, and Nd exerted the most relevant toxic effect at pH 4. The pH 6 scenario evidenced a reduction in REEs toxicity level. Mutagenicity was detected only at pH 4 by Gd (up to 3-fold compared to negative controls), La and Nd, while Ce did not show any adverse effect. Toxic effects due to Ce, Gd, La, and Nd can be reduced by controlling the pH, but several gaps of knowledge still remain about their uptake and trophic transfer, and long-term effects on targeted species.","id":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.147527"}

{"text":"<p>Climate change is altering high-latitude ecosystems in multiple facets, including increased insect herbivory pressure and enhanced emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOC) from vegetation. Yet, joint impacts of climatic drivers and insect herbivory on VOC emissions from the Arctic remain largely unknown. We examined how one-month warming by open-top plastic tents, yielding a 3\u20134 \u00b0C air temperature increase, and the natural presence of gall-forming eriophyoid mites, Aculus tetanothrix, individually and in combination, affect VOC emissions from whortle leaved willow, Salix myrsinites, at two elevations in an Arctic heath tundra of Abisko, Northern Sweden. We measured VOC emissions three times in the peak growing season (July) from intact and gall-infested branches using an enclosure technique and gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry, and leaf chemical composition using near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS). Isoprene accounted for 91% of the VOCs emitted by S. myrsinites. Isoprene emission rates tended to be higher at the high than low elevation during the measurement periods (42 \u03bcg g<sup>\u22121</sup> DW h<sup>\u22121</sup> vs. 23 \u03bcg g<sup>\u22121</sup> DW h<sup>\u22121</sup>) even when temperature differences were accounted for. Experimental warming increased isoprene emissions by approximately 54%, but decreased emissions of some minor compound groups, such as green leaf volatiles (GLV) and (E)-4,8-dimethyl-1,3,7-nonatriene (DMNT). In contrast, gall-infestation did not affect isoprene emissions but stimulated emissions of DMNT, sesquiterpenes and GLVs, particularly under ambient conditions at the low elevation. The NIRS-based chemical composition of the leaves varied between the two elevations and was affected by warming and gall-infestation. Our study suggests that under elevated temperatures, S. myrsinites increases emissions of isoprene, a highly effective compound for protection against oxidative stress, while an infestation by A. tetanothrix mites induces emissions of herbivore enemy attractants like DMNT, sesquiterpenes and GLVs. Under both conditions, warming effects on isoprene remain but mite effects on DMNT, sesquiterpenes and GLVs diminish.</p>","id":"10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.148516"}

{"text":"Open AccessElectro bioremediation is gaining interest as a sustainable treatment for contaminated groundwater. Nevertheless, the investigation is still at the laboratory level, and before their implementation is necessary to overcome important drawbacks. A prevalent issue is the high groundwater hardness that generates scale deposition on electrodes that irreversibly affects the treatment effectiveness and their lifetime. For this reason, the present study evaluated a novel and sustainable approach combining electrochemical water softening as a preliminary step for electro bioremediation of nitrate-contaminated groundwater. Batch mode tests were performed at mL-scale to determine the optimum reactor configuration (single- or two-chambers) and the suitable applied cathode potential for electrochemical softening. A single-chamber reactor working at a cathode potential of \u22121.2 V vs. Ag/AgCl was chosen. Continuous groundwater softening under this configuration achieved a hardness removal efficiency of 64 \u00b1 4% at a rate of 305 \u00b1 17 mg CaCO3 m\u22122cathode h\u22121. The saturation index at the effluent of the main minerals susceptible to precipitate (aragonite, calcite, and brucite) was reduced up to 90%. Softening activity plummeted after 13 days of operation due to precipitate deposition (mostly calcite) on the cathode surface. Polarity reversal periods were considered to detach the precipitated throughout the continuous operation. Their implementation every 3\u20134 days increased the softening lifetime by 48%, keeping a stable hardness removal efficiency. The nitrate content of softened groundwater was removed in an electro bioremediation system at a rate of 1269 \u00b1 30 g NO3\u2212 m\u22123NCC d\u22121 (97% nitrate removal efficiency).

Intercropping practices adopted in monocultural woody crops, with herbaceous crops covering the otherwise bare alleyways, foster ecological interactions and can provide both environmental and economic advantages. In this study, intercropping practices were implemented in a traditional mandarin orchard in south-eastern Spain, which was monitored for three years to assess their impact on the environmental footprint and profitability. The footprint was quantified with a cradle-to-gate life cycle assessment (LCA), while the costs and revenues assessment was based on materials, labor, and machinery used in the trial. The calculated LCA indicators evidenced that, although the cultivated surface area increases with the integration of the intercrops (fava bean, purslane, cowpea, and barley/vetch mix), this does not imply any additional detrimental effects (resource depletion, acidification, eutrophication, global warming). The economic analysis showed that while intercrops may involve additional production costs, the correct choice of intercrops, purslane, and fava bean, in this case, can reduce the market risks for farmers. Overall, this study shows that positive environmental and economic impacts are to be expected of co-integrated herbaceous crops within the same field as mandarin trees.</jats:p>","id":"10.3390/agriculture12050574"}

{"text":"Abstract   Duckweed is a potential alternative protein source for food and feed. However, little is known about the nitrate accumulation in this plant. A high nitrate level in vegetables can indirectly lead to an elevated intake of nitrites and N-nitroso compounds, increasing the risk of diseases for humans and animals. This research hypothesizes that the nitrate accumulation of Lemna minor differs between growing media. Additionally, it evaluates whether legal safety levels of nitrate for human and animal intake are exceeded. The duckweed was grown on (i) rainwater, and (ii) three synthetic media containing different nutrient levels. Furthermore, (iii) biological effluent of swine manure treatment and (iv) aquaculture effluent from pikeperch production were used, as these are potential media for closing nutrient loops in the agriculture sector. It was found that nitrate levels increased with the increasing availability of macronutrients in the water, and pH showed a particularly strong negative correlation with the nitrate levels in the plant. Nevertheless, nitrate content never exceeded 530\u00a0mg NO3 kg\u22121 fresh weight. To conclude, Lemna minor's nitrate content was below safety limits for human consumption in all tested growing media; however, a potential risk for ruminants was observed as these are more sensitive to nitrate conversions in their gastro-intestinal track.","id":"10.1016/j.ecoenv.2020.111380"}

{"text":"Abstract   The Loess Plateau (LP) is one of the most fragile eco-regions in China, and is characterized by severe soil erosion and water shortage. The fragile environment poses a threat to ecological safety and sustainable development on the LP and neighboring areas. The ecosystem on the LP has undergone great changes in recent decades owing to dramatic climate change, ecological rehabilitation, and tremendous human pressure. This study was focused on quantifying and assessing the multiple ecosystem services from 2000 to 2012, based on actual observation records and widely used biophysical models. These included Universal Soil Loss Equation (USLE), Revised Wind Erosion Equation (RWSQ), Carnegie-Ames-Stanford Approach (CASA), and rainfall storage method. Furthermore, in this study, the roles of climate variability and an ecological restoration program on vegetation activity and ecosystem services were investigated, as well as the synergies between multiple ecosystem services. The slight increase in both precipitation and temperature during 2000\u20132012, in conjunction with ecological rehabilitation, induced a trend of increasing in vegetation cover and productivity. During 2000\u20132012, the overall soil retention function was slightly enhanced while the amount of hydrological regulation decreased. The biomass production (vegetation carbon sequestration) and food production increased sharply. The increasing precipitation intensified water erosion by enhancing rainfall erosivity, whereas the reduction in wind speed lessened wind erosion and thereby reduced the frequency and duration of sandstorm events. Vegetation restoration supported by climate variability and resulting from ecological projects also played positive roles in soil retention enhancement. The spatial correlation analyses indicated synergies between multiple regulating ecosystem services. There was also a synergy between food production and carbon sequestration in vegetation. The performance of ecological rehabilitation and changes in ecosystem services on the LP exemplified the need for ecological conservation to take climate variability into account, and to facilitate synergies involving multiple ecosystem services, to maximize human well-being and preserve natural ecosystems.","id":"10.1016/j.ecoleng.2016.10.030"}

In the last few decades, various crop diversification strategies and management practices have been promoted to improve or at least maintain environmental quality and agroecosystem services. We conducted a data-analysis to evaluate the effectiveness of alternatives for crop diversification and environmentally friendly farming management for arable crops in four selected European pedoclimatic regions and typical cropping systems in the Atlantic, Boreal, Mediterranean North, and Mediterranean South regions. The dataset was retrieved from 38 references and included data on site-specific environmental conditions, soil tillage, crop rotation, fertilization, and final soil organic carbon content (SOC). No tillage (NT) was more effective (7%) in increasing SOC content than minimum tillage (MT) across the studied depths (from 5 to 40 cm). Conservation tillage as whole, including NT, MT, and rotational tillage (RT) positively affected SOC content in the top 10 cm (28%) in comparison with conventional tillage (CT). Compared to monoculture, longer crop rotations (3\u20135 years) and the introduction of legumes resulted in higher increases in SOC contents (18%), that were higher in semiarid conditions (11%) than under humid and sub-humid climates (3.2%). The effect of fertilization on SOC contents was higher in the Mediterranean North region (28%), and organic fertilization showed the highest increases (25%) compared to the control with mineral fertilization. Higher increases in SOC contents with tillage and fertilization management were found in sites with lower SOC contents in the control treatment (conventional tillage and mineral fertilization respectively). The data analysis indicated that various European arable agroecosystems benefit both from diversified cropping systems and the adoption of environmentally friendly farming management and are thereby capable to increase SOC contents.","id":"10.3390/agriculture9120261"}

In the European Union, various crop diversification systems such as crop rotation, intercropping and multiple cropping, as well as low-input management practices, have been promoted to sustain crop productivity while maintaining environmental quality and ecosystem services. We conducted a data analysis to identify the benefits of crop associations, alternative agricultural practices and strategies in four selected regions of Europe (Atlantic, Boreal, Mediterranean North and Mediterranean South) in terms of crop production (CP). The dataset was derived from 54 references with a total of 750 comparisons and included site characteristics, crop information (diversification system, crop production, tillage and fertilization management) and soil parameters. We analyzed each effect separately, comparing CP under tillage management (e.g., conventional tillage vs. no tillage), crop diversification (e.g., monoculture vs. rotation), and fertilization management (e.g., mineral fertilization vs. organic fertilization). Compared with conventional tillage (CT), CP was higher by 12% in no tillage (NT), in fine- and medium-textured soils (8\u20139%) and in arid and semiarid sites located in the Mediterranean Region (24%). Compared to monoculture, diversified cropping systems with longer crop rotations increased CP by 12%, and by 12% in soils with coarse and medium textures. In relation to fertilization, CP was increased with the use of slurry (40%), and when crop residues were incorporated (39%) or mulched (74%). Results showed that conversion to alternative diversified systems through the use of crop rotations, with NT and organic fertilization, results in a better crop performance. However, regional differences related to climate and soil-texture-specific responses should be considered to target local measures to improve soil management.","id":"10.3390/agronomy10020297"}

{"text":"International audience; The main objectives of this work are to investigate the consequences of different chemical treatments (i.e. potassium hydroxide (KOH) and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2)) and the effect of biochar washing on the Pb sorption capacity. Biochars derived from sewage sludge digestate and the organic fraction of municipal solid waste digestate were separately modified with 2\u202fM KOH or 10% H2O2 followed by semi-continuous or continuous washing with ultrapure water using batch or a column reactor, respectively. The results showed that the Pb adsorption capacity could be enhanced by chemical treatment of sludge-based biochar. Indeed, for municipal solid waste biochar, the Pb maximum sorption capacity was improved from 73 mg g\u22121 for unmodified biochar to 90 mg g\u22121 and 106 mg g\u22121 after H2O2 and KOH treatment, respectively. In the case of sewage sludge biochar, it increased from 6.5 mg g\u22121 (unmodified biochar) to 25 mg g\u22121 for H2O2 treatment. The sorption capacity was not determined after KOH treatment, since the Langmuir model did not fit the experimental data. The study also highlights that insufficient washing after KOH treatment can strongly hinder Pb sorption due to the release of organic matter from the modified biochar. This organic matter may interact in solution with Pb, resulting in an inhibition of its sorption onto the biochar surface. Continuous column-washing of modified biochars was able to correct this issue, highlighting the importance of implementing a proper treated biochar washing procedure.","id":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.04.108"}

{"text":"<jats:p>Abstract. Satellite Earth observations (EO) are an accurate and reliable data source for atmospheric and environmental science. Their increasing spatial and temporal resolution, as well as the seamless availability over ungauged regions, make them appealing for hydrological modeling. This work shows recent advances in the use of high-resolution satellite-based Earth observation data in hydrological modelling. In a set of experiments, the distributed hydrological model Continuum is set up for the Po River Basin (Italy) and forced, in turn, by satellite precipitation and evaporation, while satellite-derived soil moisture and snow depths are ingested into the model structure through a data-assimilation scheme. Further, satellite-based estimates of precipitation, evaporation and river discharge are used for hydrological model calibration, and results are compared with those based on ground observations. Despite the high density of conventional ground measurements and the strong human influence in the focus region, all satellite products show strong potential for operational hydrological applications, with skillful estimates of river discharge throughout the model domain. Satellite-based evaporation and snow depths marginally improve (by 2 % and 4 %) the mean Kling-Gupta efficiency (KGE) at 27 river gauges, compared to a baseline simulation (KGEmean = 0.51) forced by high-quality conventional data. Precipitation has the largest impact on the model output, though the satellite dataset on average shows poorer skills compared to conventional data. Interestingly, a model calibration heavily relying on satellite data, as opposed to conventional data, provides a skillful reconstruction of river discharges, paving the way to fully satellite-driven hydrological applications.                         </jats:p>","id":"10.5194/hess-26-3921-2022"}

{"text":"Abstract   The green infrastructure (GI) is a network of natural and semi-natural areas with environmental features that is designed and managed to deliver a wide range of ecosystem services. The concept has roots in the former hierarchical system of ecological networks. There are several examples of GIs, but details of their implementation at a landscape level are often missing or they have been used non-systematically. Here, we demonstrate opportunities for landscape-level implementation of GIs based on spatial analysis through the application of ecological engineering or other measures. Using maps and expert evaluations of different land-use types, we created a methodology for national-scale determination of Estonia\u2019s GI. Based on spatially explicit datasets (e.g., land cover, soils, topography, roads), we determined the proportions of greenness and brownness (primarily anthropogenic) landscape indices. Areas with the highest greenness values served as the GI\u2019s core areas, whereas areas with the greatest anthropogenic composition represented the brown infrastructure. Identification and classification of hotspots where the two infrastructures are in conflict (e.g., construction, mining areas, roads, settlements, airports, power lines, wind turbines) revealed locations where ecological engineering and other measures are needed to mitigate or eliminate the conflict. Developing spatially explicit models of the conflicts between the infrastructures represents a new approach in landscape planning and environmental management that links coarse-scale landscape planning and regional landscape plans with more detailed local landscape plans that support the design of site-specific ecological engineering and other measures. We demonstrate that the implementation of GIs is inseparably connected with ecological engineering and landscape-scale planning.","id":"10.1016/j.ecoleng.2018.05.019"}

{"text":"Open AccessPeer reviewed Open Access in https://zenodo.org/record/1323892 10 p\u00e1ginas.- 5 figuras.- 1 tabla.- referencias.- Supplementary data associated with this article can be found, in the online version, at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolind.2018.03.034 The Nutrient Cycling Index (hereafter \u2018Nutrient Index\u2019) derived from Landscape Function Analysis (LFA) is used extensively by land managers worldwide to obtain rapid and cost-effective information on soil condition and nutrient status in terrestrial ecosystems. Despite its utility, relatively little is known about its reliability under different management conditions (e.g. grazing) or across different climatic zones (aridity). Here we correlated the Nutrient Index, comprising measures of biocrust cover, plant basal cover, soil roughness and three attributes of surface litter cover, with empirical data on measures of soil total nutrient pools (C and N), nutrient availability (labile C, inorganic N and P), and decomposition-related enzymes at 151 locations from eastern Australia varying in grazing intensity and climatic conditions. Grazing intensity was assessed by measuring current grazing (dung production by the herbivores cattle, sheep/goats, kangaroos and rabbits), and historic grazing (the total area of livestock tracks leading from water). We used aridity (the relationship between precipitation and potential evapotranspiration) as a measure of climate. On average, the Nutrient Index was positively associated with total nutrient pools, nutrient availability and decomposition enzymes. However, further statistical modelling indicated that grazing intensity strongly reduced the link between the index and decomposition enzymes, labile C and inorganic P, but not with total nutrient pools. This grazing effect was predominantly due to cattle. Conversely, aridity had no significant effect on the predictive power of the index, suggesting that it could be used across different aridity conditions in natural ecosystems as a reliable predictor of soil health. Overall, our study reveals that the Nutrient Index is a robust predictor of total nutrient pools across different aridity and grazing conditions, but not for predicting nutrient availability or decomposition in environments heavily grazed by livestock.

{"text":"<jats:p>Abstract. The increasing availability of satellite data is a real value for the enhancement of environmental knowledge and land management. Possibilities to integrate different source of geo-data are growing and methodologies to create thematic database are becoming very sophisticated. Moreover, the access to internet services and, in particular, to web mapping services is well developed and spread either between expert users than the citizens. Web map services, like Google Maps or Open Street Maps, give the access to updated optical imagery or topographic maps but information on land cover/use \u2013 are not still provided. Therefore, there are many failings in the general utilization \u2013non-specialized users- and access to those maps. This issue is particularly felt where the digital (web) maps could form the basis for land use management as they are more economic and accessible than the paper maps.

{"text":"Abstract   This multi-disciplinary research paper should help solar power plant developers to perform an advanced site assessment in arid locations where the annual irradiance levels are high, but significant quantities of airborne sand and dust increase the risk of optical energy losses due to extinction, soiling, erosion damage (also known as abrasion), etc. Due to these effects sandstorms have a direct consequence on the operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. The work presented in the following characterizes airborne sand and dust material and later focuses on the resulting erosion effects. Some important meteorological and geological parameters for sandstorm occurrence and the resulting erosive damage on glass materials by impacting windblown material are extracted from literature. The respective parameters have been measured at two locations in Morocco (Zagora and Missour). After evaluation of wind and humidity data and a comprehensive soil analysis, the erosion risk was estimated to be higher in Zagora. The specular reflectance loss of exposed silvered-glass reflectors of 5.9% in Zagora and 0.8% in Missour after 25\u202fmonths of exposure verified this estimation. Additionally, a specular reflectance analysis on a mirror sample that has been exposed for nine months in Kuwait is shown. On that sample specular reflectance losses of more than 40% were measured. A checklist with seven items is given in the conclusion to help solar plant developers to evaluate the risk of component aging due to sand storm erosion.","id":"10.1016/j.solener.2018.01.004"}

{"text":"Abstract   To meet the growing challenges for food security, renewable resource production and climate change adaptation, optimized crop rotations (OCRs) should aim to maximize biomass production and export from the field while minimizing carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) footprints. However, the effects of OCRs on aboveground biomass production and soil C and N stock as well as the potential links between them remain poorly understood. In this study in Denmark, we harvested all aboveground biomass and simultaneously investigated soil C and N content and stock in two continuous monocultures (CMs) as well as in four OCRs. Across five-year continuous observations, OCRs significantly increased cumulative aboveground biomass production by 23% compared to CMs. There was no significant difference between OCRs and CMs in soil C and N content in any of the soil layers (0\u201320, 20\u201350, and 50\u2013100\u00a0cm) after the five years. Moreover, OCRs had no effect on top layer soil C and N stock compared to CMs, even when examined by equivalent soil mass. Slight reductions in soil C and N stock after five years in both OCRs and CMs did not relate to the changes in aboveground biomass production. Our results highlight that it is feasible to produce more biomass for biorefineries in OCRs than in CMs and the reductions in soil C and N stock over time seem similar for the two systems. Longer-term continuous observations are called for to underpin these results.","id":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2020.106669"}

{"text":"Abstract   There is a pressing need for indicators and methods to quantify the provision of ecosystem services as a prerequisite to identify management options that optimize trade-offs between services. Arable weeds provide multiple services and are thus a good model to evaluate such trade\u2013offs. This flora provides trophic resources (flowers or seeds) that support pollinators and pest natural enemies (pollination and pest control services) but can also be harmful for crop production (disservice). To date, few indicators are available to quantify the contribution of weeds to ecosystem services or their harmfulness, and no indicators account for intraspecific variability in weed traits that result from contrasting growing conditions, notably the location of weeds within fields (field edge vs field core) and crop type. Here, we developed nine proxies for potential weed harmfulness (competition, harvest difficulties and future weed infestations) and weed contributions to resources provision to pollinators (bees, bumblebees and hoverflies) and pest natural enemies (carabid beetles, birds and parasitoid wasps). These nine proxies accounted for individual weed plant response to growing conditions (combination of within-field location by crop type) for 155 weed species, resulting in 967 unique situations (combinations of species by within-field locations by crop types). Apart from harvest difficulties, all proxies were positively correlated, i.e. harmfulness increased when services increased. Weed plants located on field edges had greater contributions to all proxies than those located in field cores, especially in cereal crops. We identified that small weed species with short life cycles and low competitiveness, presented the optimum proxy combination, i.e. high services and low harmfulness. The development of these proxies and the proposed framework provide new avenues for assessing trade-offs between multiple ecosystem services at different temporal (crop sequence) and spatial scales (landscape).","id":"10.1016/j.ecolind.2021.108321"}

{"text":"Abstract   During the past twenty years, the Nordic countries (Denmark, Sweden, Finland and Norway) have introduced a range of measures to reduce losses of nitrogen (N) to air and to aquatic environment by leaching and runoff. However, the agricultural sector is still an important N source to the environment, and projections indicate relatively small emission reductions in the coming years.  The four Nordic countries have different priorities and strategies regarding agricultural N flows and mitigation measures, and therefore they are facing different challenges and barriers. In Norway farm subsidies are used to encourage measures, but these are mainly focused on phosphorus (P). In contrast, Denmark targets N and uses control regulations to reduce losses. In Sweden and Finland, both voluntary actions combined with subsidies help to mitigate both N and P.  The aim of this study was to compare the present situation pertaining to agricultural N in the Nordic countries as well as to provide recommendations for policy instruments to achieve cost effective abatement of reactive N from agriculture in the Nordic countries, and to provide guidance to other countries.  To further reduce N losses from agriculture, the four countries will have to continue to take different routes. In particular, some countries will need new actions if 2020 and 2030 National Emissions Ceilings Directive (NECD) targets are to be met. Many options are possible, including voluntary action, regulation, taxation and subsidies, but the difficulty is finding the right balance between these policy options for each country.  The governments in the Nordic countries should put more attention to the NECD and consult with relevant stakeholders, researchers and farmer's associations on which measures to prioritize to achieve these goals on time. It is important to pick remaining low hanging fruits through use of the most cost effective mitigation measures. We suggest that N application rate and its timing should be in accordance with the crop need and carrying capacity of environmental recipients. Also, the choice of application technology can further reduce the risk of N losses into air and waters. This may require more region-specific solutions and knowledge-based support with tailored information in combination with further targeted subsidies or regulations.","id":"10.1016/j.jenvman.2018.11.143"}

{"text":"This work investigates a power dispatch system that aims to supply the power demand of the EU and Western Balkans (EUWB) based on low-carbon generation units, enabled by the expansion of biomass, solar, and wind based electricity. A spatially explicit techno-economic optimization tool simulates the EUWB power sector to explore the dispatch of new renewable electricity capacity on a EUWB scale, under ambitious CO2 emission policies. The results show that utility-scale deployment of renewable electricity is feasible and can contribute about 9\u201339% of the total generation mix, for a carbon price range of 0\u2013200 \u20ac/tCO2 and with the existing capacities of the cross-border transmission network. Even without any explicit carbon incentive (carbon price of 0 \u20ac/tCO2), more than 35% of the variable power in the most ambitious CO2 mitigation scenario (carbon price of 200 \u20ac/tCO2) would be economically feasible to deploy. Spatial assessment of bio-electricity potential (based on forest and agriculture feedstock) showed limited presence in the optimal generation mix (0\u20136%), marginalizing its effect as baseload. Expansion of the existing cross-border transmission capacities helps even out the variability of solar and wind technologies, but may also result in lower installed RE capacity in favor of state-of-the-art natural gas with relatively low sensitivity to increasing carbon taxes. A sensitivity analysis of the investment cost, even under a low-investment scenario and at the high end of the CO2 price range, showed natural gas remains at around 11% of the total generation, emphasizing how costly it would be to achieve the final percentages toward a 100% renewable system.","id":"10.1016/j.energy.2018.09.034"}

{"text":"Abstract   The evolution of natural slopes over time is ruled by several concurrent physical phenomena, namely the strength of its component geomaterials and their weakening over time due to weathering processes, the occurrence of seismic events, seepage and the formation of tension cracks. The paper presents analytical solutions obtained considering a succession of discrete failure events (landslides) progressively altering the slope morphology over time. The model, derived in the framework of limit analysis assuming plane strain conditions, provides a tool for the assessment of whether manufacts and/or infrastructures located on a slope subject to various natural degradation phenomena will be affected by the occurrence of failures.  Unlike current empirical and semi-empirical models of slope evolution, the analytical solution that is here presented is derived by applying principles of soil and rock mechanics, therefore it is of general validity, so that no ad\u2013hoc calibration against past observations of the evolving slope is needed. This analytical technique only requires knowledge of the (geotechnical) parameters characterising the geomaterials comprising the slope of interest, namely angle of shearing resistance, \u03d5, cohesion, c, tensile strength, unit weight, together with knowledge of the relevant seepage scenarios, strength degradation processes, and seismic events likely to occur.  Results show that that earthquake loading and seepage can substantially decrease slope stability, increase the volume of material sliding away during each landslide event and alter the evolution of the slope over time, while tensile strength exhibits a less strong influence especially as strength degradation progresses. Dimensionless ready-to-use charts are provided for the benefit of practitioners.","id":"10.1016/j.enggeo.2016.09.005"}

Temperature is one of the key abiotic factors during the life of plants, especially in the Arctic region which is currently experiencing rapid climate change. We evaluated plant traits and environmental variables determining leaf temperature in tundra shrubs and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions with field measurements on deciduous tundra shrubs, Salix myrsinites and Betula nana, and evergreen Cassiope tetragona and Rhododendron lapponicum. Higher leaf-to-air temperature difference was observed in evergreen, compared to deciduous shrubs. Evergreen shrubs also showed continuously increasing photosynthesis with increasing temperature, suggesting high thermal tolerance. For the deciduous species, the optimum temperature for net photosynthesis was between our measurement temperatures of 24\u2009\u00b0C and 38\u2009\u00b0C. Air temperature and vapor pressure deficit were the most important variables influencing leaf temperature and VOC emissions in all the studied plants, along with stomatal density and specific leaf area in the deciduous shrubs. Using climate data and emission factors from our measurements, we modelled total seasonal tundra shrub VOC emissions of 0.3\u20132.3\u2009g\u2009m\u22122 over the main growing season.

The impact of temperature and discharge on manganese release from a riverbed were assessed by water quality data from a monitoring transect at a riverbank filtration site in Dresden-Tolkewitz. Column experiments with riverbed material were used to assess the Mn release for four temperature and three discharge conditions, represented by varying infiltration rates. The observed Mn release was modeled as kinetic reactions via Monod-type rate formulations in PHREEQC. The temperature had a bigger impact than the infiltration rates on the Mn release. Infiltration rates of &lt d) required temperatures &gt 20 &deg 0.3 m3/(m2&middot C to trigger the Mn release. With increasing temperatures, the infiltration rates became less important. The modeled consumption rates of dissolved oxygen are in agreement with results from other bank filtration sites and are potentially suited for the further application of the given conditions. The determined Mn reduction rate constants were appropriate to simulate Mn release from the riverbed sediments but seemed not to be suited for simulations in which Mn reduction is likely to occur within the aquifer. Sequential extractions revealed a decrease of easily reducible Mn up to 25%, which was found to reflect the natural stratification within the riverbed, rather than a depletion of the Mn reservoir.","id":"10.3390/w10101476"}

The study addresses the conflict, which arises between the stochastic character of river water quantity and quality, and the required standard of drinking-water supply. Trends in water levels, flow, and water quality are discussed, along with technical measures and operational rules that were developed for implementation of RBF systems. This paper also provides an overview of the average lifespan of the wells and operational strategies. The emerging reconstruction and reconditioning needs are highlighted, and existing alternatives are presented. Large-scale infrastructural elements, such as the Danube-based RBF systems, have to be adapted to a changing environment. The increasing frequency of floods and droughts stresses the need to implement climate-adapted RBF systems and related operational strategies.

{"text":"<jats:p>The implementation of nature-based solutions (NBSs) can be a suitable and sustainable approach to coping with environmental issues related to diffuse water pollution from agriculture. NBSs exploit natural mitigation processes that can promote the removal of different contaminants from agricultural wastewater, and they can also enable the recovery of otherwise lost resources (i.e., nutrients). Among these, nitrogen impacts different ecosystems, resulting in serious environmental and human health issues. Recent research activities have investigated the capability of NBS to remove nitrogen from polluted water. However, the regulating mechanisms for nitrogen removal can be complex, since a wide range of decontamination pathways, such as plant uptake, microbial degradation, substrate adsorption and filtration, precipitation, sedimentation, and volatilization, can be involved. Investigating these processes is beneficial for the enhancement of the performance of NBSs. The present study provides a comprehensive review of factors that can influence nitrogen removal in different types of NBSs, and the possible strategies for nitrogen recovery that have been reported in the literature.</jats:p>","id":"10.3390/w13141893"}

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience Soil biodiversity and habitat provisioning is one of the soil functions that agricultural land provides to society. This paper describes assessment of the soil biodiversity function (SB function) as a proof of concept to be used in a decision support tool for agricultural land management. The SB function is defined as 'the multitude of soil organisms and processes, interacting in an ecosystem, providing society with a rich biodiversity source and contributing to a habitat for aboveground organisms.' So far, no single measure provides the full overview of the soil biodiversity and how a soil supports a habitat for a biodiverse ecosystem. We have assembled a set of attributes for a proxy-indicator system, based on four 'integrated attributes': (1) soil nutrient status, (2) soil biological status, (3) soil structure, and (4) soil hydrological status. These attributes provide information to be used in a model for assessing the capacity of a soil to supply the SB function. A multi-criteria decision model was developed which comprises of 34 attributes providing information to quantify the four integrated attributes and subsequently assess the SB function for grassland and for cropland separately. The model predictions (in terms of low-moderate-high soil biodiversity status) were compared with expert judgements for a collection of 137 grassland soils in the Netherlands and 52 French soils, 29 grasslands, and 23 croplands. For both datasets, the results show that the proposed model predictions were statistically significantly correlated with the expert judgements. A sensitivity analysis indicated that the soil nutrient status, defined by attributes such as pH and organic carbon content, was the most important integrated attribute in the assessment of the SB function.

{"text":"Soils perform many functions that are vital to societies, among which their capability to regulate global climate has received much attention over the past decades. An assessment of the extent to which soils perform a specific function is not only important to appropriately value their current capacity, but also to make well-informed decisions about how and where to change soil management to align the delivered soil functions with societal demands. To obtain an overview of the capacity of soils to perform different functions, accurate and easy-to-use models are necessary. A problem with most currently-available models is that data requirements often exceed data availability, while generally a high level of expert knowledge is necessary to apply these models. Therefore, we developed a qualitative model to assess how agricultural soils function with respect to climate regulation. The model is driven by inputs about agricultural management practices, soil properties and environmental conditions. To reduce data requirements on stakeholders, the 17 input variables are classified into either (1) three classes: low, medium and high or (2) the presence or absence of a management practice. These inputs are combined using a decision tree with internal integration rules to obtain an estimate of the magnitude of N2O emissions and carbon sequestration. These two variables are subsequently combined into an estimate of the capacity of a soil to perform the climate regulation function. The model was tested using data from long-term field experiments across Europe. This showed that the model is generally able to adequately assess this soil function across a range of environments under different management practices. In a next step, this model will be combined with models to assess other soil functions (soil biodiversity, primary productivity, nutrient cycling and water regulation and purification). This will allow for the assessment of the trade-offs between these soil functions for agricultural land across Europe.","id":"10.3389/fenvs.2019.00131"}

{"text":"<jats:p>DISPATCH is a disaggregation algorithm of the low-resolution soil moisture (SM) estimates derived from passive microwave observations. It provides disaggregated SM data at typically 1\u00a0km resolution by using the soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) estimated from optical/thermal data collected around solar noon. DISPATCH is based on the relationship between the evapo-transpiration rate and the surface SM under non-energy-limited conditions and hence is well adapted for semi-arid regions with generally low cloud cover and sparse vegetation. The objective of this paper is to extend the spatio-temporal coverage of DISPATCH data by 1) including more densely vegetated areas and 2) assessing the usefulness of thermal data collected earlier in the morning. Especially, we evaluate the performance of the Temperature Vegetation Dryness Index (TVDI) instead of SEE in the DISPATCH algorithm over vegetated areas (called vegetation-extended DISPATCH) and we quantify the increase in coverage using Sentinel-3 (overpass at around 09:30 am) instead of MODIS (overpass at around 10:30 am and 1:30 pm for Terra and Aqua, respectively) data. In this study, DISPATCH is applied to 36\u00a0km resolution Soil Moisture Active and Passive SM data over three 50\u00a0km by 50\u00a0km areas in Spain and France to assess the effectiveness of the approach over temperate and semi-arid regions. The use of TVDI within DISPATCH increases the coverage of disaggregated images by 9 and 14% over the temperate and semi-arid sites, respectively. Moreover, including the vegetated pixels in the validation areas increases the overall correlation between satellite and <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> SM from 0.36 to 0.43 and from 0.41 to 0.79 for the temperate and semi-arid regions, respectively. The use of Sentinel-3 can increase the spatio-temporal coverage by up to 44% over the considered MODIS tile, while the overlapping disaggregated data sets derived from Sentinel-3 and MODIS land surface temperature data are strongly correlated (around 0.7). Additionally, the correlation between satellite and <jats:italic>in situ</jats:italic> SM is significantly better for DISPATCH (0.39\u20130.80) than for the Copernicus Sentinel-1-based (\u22120.03 to 0.69) and SMAP/S1 (0.37\u20130.74) product over the three studies (temperate and semi-arid) areas, with an increase in yearly valid retrievals for the vegetation-extended DISPATCH algorithm.</jats:p>","id":"10.3389/fenvs.2021.555216"}

{"text":"<jats:p>Microplastic as an anthropogenic pollutant accumulates in terrestrial ecosystems over time, threatening soil quality and health, for example by decreasing aggregate stability. Organic matter addition is an efficient approach to promote aggregate stability, yet little is known about whether microplastic can reduce the beneficial effect of organic matter on aggregate stability. We investigated the impacts of microplastic fibers in the presence or absence of different organic materials by carrying out a soil incubation experiment. This experiment was set up as a fully factorial design containing all combinations of microplastic fibers (no microplastic fiber addition, two different types of polyester fibers, and polyacrylic) and organic matter (no organic matter addition, <jats:italic>Medicago lupulina</jats:italic> leaves, <jats:italic>Plantago lanceolata</jats:italic> leaves, wheat straw, and hemp stems). We evaluated the percentage of water-stable aggregates (WSA) and activities of four soil enzymes (\u03b2-glucosidase, \u03b2-D-celluliosidase, N-acetyl-b-glucosaminidase, phosphatase). Organic matter addition increased WSA and enzyme activities, as expected. In particular, Plantago or wheat straw addition increased WSA and enzyme activities by 224.77 or 281.65% and 298.51 or 55.45%, respectively. Microplastic fibers had no effect on WSA and enzyme activities in the soil without organic matter addition, but decreased WSA and enzyme activities by 26.20 or 37.57% and 23.85 or 26.11%, respectively, in the presence of Plantago or wheat straw. Our study shows that the effects of microplastic fibers on soil aggregation and enzyme activities are organic matter dependent. A possible reason is that <jats:italic>Plantago</jats:italic> and wheat straw addition stimulated soil aggregation to a greater degree, resulting in more newly formed aggregates containing microplastic, the incorporated microplastic fibers led to less stable aggregates, and decrease in enzyme activities This highlights an important aspect of the context dependency of microplastic effects in soil and on soil health. Our results also suggest risks for soil stability associated with organic matter additions, such as is common in agroecosystems, when microplastics are present.</jats:p>","id":"10.3389/fenvs.2021.650155"}

{"text":"Open AccessPeer reviewed Endophytic fungi of crops can promote plant growth through various mechanisms of action (i.e., improve nutrient uptake and nutrient use efficiency, and produce and modulate plant hormones). The genus Brassica includes important horticultural crops, which have been little studied in their interaction with endophytic fungi. Previously, four endophytic fungi were isolated from kale roots (Brassica oleracea var. acephala), with different benefits for their host, including plant growth promotion, cold tolerance, and induction of resistance to pathogens (Xanthomonas campestris) and pests (Mamestra brassicae). In the present work, the molecular and morphological identification of the four different isolates were carried out, describing them as the species Acrocalymma vagum, Setophoma terrestris, Fusarium oxysporum, and the new species Pyrenophora gallaeciana. In addition, using a representative crop of each Brassica U's triangle species and various in vitro biochemical tests, the ability of these fungi to promote plant growth was described. In this sense, the four fungi used promoted the growth of B. rapa, B. napus, B. nigra, B. juncea, and B. carinata, possibly due to the production of auxins, siderophores, P solubilization or cellulase, xylanase or amylase activity. Finally, the differences in root colonization between the four endophytic fungi and two pathogens (Leptosphaeria maculans and Sclerotinia sclerotiorum) and the root glucosinolate profile were studied, at different times. In this way, how the presence of progoitrin in the roots reduces their colonization by endophytic and pathogenic fungi was determined, while the possible hydrolysis of sinigrin to fungicidal products controls the colonization of endophytic fungi, but not of pathogens.

{"text":"Open Access[EN] Since membranes play essential roles in all living beings, all cells have developed mechanisms for efficient and fast repair of membrane damage. InEscherichia coli, the Phage shock stress A (PspA) protein is involved in the maintenance of the integrity of its inner membrane in response to the damage produced by exposure to stress conditions. A role in thylakoid membrane maintenance and reorganization has been proposed for Vesicle Inducing Protein in Plastid 1 (VIPP1), the putative PspA ortholog inArabidopsis thaliana. While some membranes of plant cells have been extensively studied, the biosynthesis and maintenance of chloroplast thylakoid membrane remains poorly known. Here, we report the cloning and functional characterization of the tomato (Solanum lycopersicumL.) ortholog ofEscherichia coli PspAandArabidopsis thaliana VIPP1, which we dubbedSlVIPP1. Our genetic and molecular characterization ofslvipp1, an insertional mutant, allowed us to conclude that the tomatoSlVIPP1gene is needed for development, as ArabidopsisVIPP1, but notEscherichia coli PspA. Homozygousslvipp1tomato plants are albino and exhibit early lethality and highly aberrant chloroplast development with almost complete absence of thylakoids. The phenotype of tomato RNAi lines and that of additionalslvipp1alleles generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing technology confirmed that the morphological and histological aberrations shown byslvipp1homozygotes are caused byVIPP1lack of function. We also found that tomatoSlVIPP1overexpression does not cause any visible effect on plant morphology and viability. Our work withslvipp1plants evidences thatSlVIPP1is an essential gene required for tomato survival, since its function is crucial for the proper formation and/or maintenance of thylakoid membranes.

{"text":"<jats:p>Abstract. Pleistocene ice complex permafrost deposits contain roughly a quarter of the organic carbon (OC) stored in permafrost (PF) terrain. When permafrost thaws, its OC is remobilized into the (aquatic) environment where it is available for degradation, transport or burial. Aquatic or coastal environments contain sedimentary reservoirs that can serve as archives of past climatic change. As permafrost thaw is increasing throughout the Arctic, these reservoirs are important locations to assess the fate of remobilized permafrost OC.We here present compound-specific deuterium (\u03b42H) analysis on leaf waxes as a tool to distinguish between OC released from thawing Pleistocene permafrost (ice complex deposits; ICD) and from thawing Holocene permafrost (from near-surface soils). Bulk geochemistry (%OC; \u03b413C; %total nitrogen, TN) was analyzed as well as the concentrations and \u03b42H signatures of long-chain n-alkanes (C21 to C33) and mid- to long-chain n-alkanoic acids (C16 to C30) extracted from both ICD-PF samples (n\u2009=\u2009\u202f9) and modern vegetation and O-horizon (topsoil-PF) samples (n\u2009=\u2009\u202f9) from across the northeast Siberian Arctic.  Results show that these topsoil-PF samples have higher %OC, higher OC\u202f\u2215\u202fTN values and more depleted \u03b413C-OC values than ICD-PF samples, suggesting that these former samples trace a fresher soil and/or vegetation source. Whereas the two investigated sources differ on the bulk geochemical level, they are, however, virtually indistinguishable when using leaf wax concentrations and ratios.  However, on the molecular isotope level, leaf wax biomarker \u03b42H values are statistically different between topsoil PF and ICD PF. For example, the mean \u03b42H value of C29\u00a0n-alkane was \u2212246\u202f\u00b1\u202f13\u202f\u2030 (mean\u202f\u00b1\u202fSD) for topsoil PF and \u2212280\u202f\u00b1\u202f12\u202f\u2030 for ICD PF. With a dynamic isotopic range (difference between two sources) of 34 to 50\u202f\u2030; the isotopic fingerprints of individual, abundant, biomarker molecules from leaf waxes can thus serve as endmembers to distinguish between these two sources. We tested this molecular \u03b42H tracer along with another source-distinguishing approach, dual-carbon (\u03b413C\u2013\u039414C) isotope composition of bulk OC, for a surface sediment transect in the Laptev Sea. Results show that general offshore patterns along the shelf-slope transect are similar, but the source apportionment between the approaches vary, which may highlight the advantages of either. This study indicates that the application of \u03b42H leaf wax values has potential to serve as a complementary quantitative measure of the source and differential fate of OC thawed out from different permafrost compartments.                     </jats:p>","id":"10.5194/tc-11-1879-2017"}

{"text":"<jats:p>Abstract. Current land surface models (LSMs) typically represent soils in a\u00a0very simplistic way, assuming soil organic carbon (SOC) as a\u00a0bulk, and thus impeding a\u00a0correct representation of deep soil carbon dynamics. Moreover, LSMs generally neglect the production and export of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) from soils to rivers, leading to overestimations of the potential carbon sequestration on land. This common oversimplified processing of SOC in LSMs is partly responsible for the large uncertainty in the predictions of the soil carbon response to climate change. In this study, we present a\u00a0new soil carbon module called ORCHIDEE-SOM, embedded within the land surface model ORCHIDEE, which is able to reproduce the DOC and SOC dynamics in a\u00a0vertically discretized soil to 2\u202fm. The model includes processes of biological production and consumption of SOC and DOC, DOC adsorption on and desorption from soil minerals, diffusion of SOC and DOC, and DOC transport with water through and out of the soils to rivers. We evaluated ORCHIDEE-SOM against observations of DOC concentrations and SOC stocks from four European sites with different vegetation covers: a\u00a0coniferous forest, a\u00a0deciduous forest, a\u00a0grassland, and a\u00a0cropland. The model was able to reproduce the SOC stocks along their vertical profiles at the four sites and the DOC concentrations within the range of measurements, with the exception of the DOC concentrations in the upper soil horizon at the coniferous forest. However, the model was not able to fully capture the temporal dynamics of DOC concentrations. Further model improvements should focus on a\u00a0plant- and depth-dependent parameterization of the new input model parameters, such as the turnover times of DOC and the microbial carbon use efficiency. We suggest that this new soil module, when parameterized for global simulations, will improve the representation of the global carbon cycle in LSMs, thus helping to constrain the predictions of the future SOC response to global warming.                     </jats:p>","id":"10.5194/gmd-11-937-2018"}

{"text":"<jats:p>Microbial decomposers face large stoichiometric imbalances when feeding on nutrient-poor plant residues. To meet the challenges of nutrient limitation, microorganisms might: (i) allocate less carbon (C) to growth vs. respiration or excretion (i.e., flexible C-use efficiency, CUE), (ii) produce extracellular enzymes to target compounds that supply the most limiting element, (iii) modify their cellular composition according to the external nutrient availability, and (iv) preferentially retain nutrients at senescence. These four resource use modes can have different consequences on the litter C and nitrogen (N) dynamics\u2013modes that selectively remove C from the system can reduce C storage in soil, whereas modes that delay C mineralization and increase internal N recycling could promote storage of C and N. Since we do not know which modes are dominant in litter decomposers, we cannot predict the fate of C and N released from plant residues, in particular under conditions of microbial nutrient limitation. To address this question, we developed a process-based model of litter decomposition in which these four resource use modes were implemented. We then parameterized the model using \u223c80 litter decomposition datasets spanning a broad range of litter qualities. The calibrated model variants were able to capture most of the variability in litter C, N, and lignin fractions during decomposition regardless of which modes were included. This suggests that different modes can lead to similar litter decomposition trajectories (thanks to the multiple alternative resource acquisition pathways), and that identification of dominant modes is not possible using \u201cstandard\u201d litter decomposition data (an equifinality problem). Our results thus point to the need of exploring microbial adaptations to nutrient limitation with empirical estimates of microbial traits and to develop models flexible enough to consider a range of hypothesized microbial responses.</jats:p>","id":"10.3389/ffgc.2021.686945"}

{"text":"Thermal degradation of synthetic and natural polymers is an important process in many fields of engineering such as fire safety, thermal recycling, and biomass power generation. The kinetics of thermal degradation is usually studied by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), which is based on measuring the mass loss rate of a microscale sample and the temperature of the surrounding fluid during controlled heating. The literature is rich in TGA measurements, which are commonly assumed to be governed solely by kinetics. Heat and mass transfer effects, however, can occur when the sample is insufficiently small in size. Only a few studies quantify a threshold for this maximum size. These thresholds vary due to different input parameters and formulations of the used model. Here, we aim to systematically analyse the role of heat transfer in TGA experiments, quantify the uncertainty of current models, and provide a novel threshold for maximum sample size. We focused on the natural polymer cellulose, a surrogate for biomass, and split the problem into heat transfer within the sample (intraparticle) and between the sample and the fluid (interparticle). Using dimensional analysis we derived two upper bound thresholds for the initial sample mass as a function of heating rate above these thresholds heat transfer effects are significant. One threshold is calculated based on interparticle heat transfer and depends on flow conditions, material and fluid properties. The other is calculated based on intraparticle heat transfer and only depends on material properties. Both thresholds were validated with experiments and previous studies from the literature. Comparing both thresholds shows that the maximum sample mass in a TGA is always limited by interparticle heat transfer. These results enable the selection of appropriate samples masses and heating condition in TGA experiments, which in turn will lead to a better understanding of the pyrolysis chemistry of polymers.","id":"10.3389/fmech.2018.00018"}

{"text":"Diazotrophic microorganisms introduce biologically available nitrogen (N) to the global N cycle through the activity of the nitrogenase enzyme. The genetically conserved dinitrogenase reductase (nifH) gene is phylogenetically distributed across four clusters (I-IV) and is widely used as a marker gene for N2 fixation, permitting investigators to study the genetic diversity of diazotrophs in nature and target potential participants in N2 fixation. To date there have been limited, standardized pipelines for analyzing the nifH functional gene, which is in stark contrast to the 16S rRNA gene. Here we present a bioinformatics pipeline for processing nifH amplicon datasets - NifMAP ('NifH MiSeq Illumina Amplicon Analysis Pipeline'), which as a novel aspect uses Hidden-Markov Models to filter out homologous genes to nifH. By using this pipeline, we evaluated the broadly inclusive primer pairs (Ueda19F-R6, IGK3-DVV, and F2-R6) that target the nifH gene. To evaluate any systematic biases, the nifH gene was amplified with the aforementioned primer pairs in a diverse collection of environmental samples (soils, rhizosphere and roots samples, biological soil crusts and estuarine samples), in addition to a nifH mock community consisting of six phylogenetically diverse members. We noted that all primer pairs co-amplified nifH homologs to varying degrees; up to 90% of the amplicons were nifH homologs with IGK3-DVV in some samples (rhizosphere and roots from tall oat-grass). In regards to specificity, we observed some degree of bias across the primer pairs. For example, primer pair F2-R6 discriminated against cyanobacteria (amongst others), yet captured many sequences from subclusters IIIE and IIIL-N. These aforementioned subclusters were largely missing by the primer pair IGK3-DVV, which also tended to discriminate against Alphaproteobacteria, but amplified sequences within clusters IIIC (affiliated with Clostridia) and clusters IVB and IVC. Primer pair Ueda19F-R6 exhibited the least bias and successfully captured diazotrophs in cluster I and subclusters IIIE, IIIL, IIIM, and IIIN, but tended to discriminate against Firmicutes and subcluster IIIC. Taken together, our newly established bioinformatics pipeline, NifMAP, along with our systematic evaluations of nifH primer pairs permit more robust, high-throughput investigations of diazotrophs in diverse environments.","id":"10.3389/fmicb.2018.00703"}

{"text":"<jats:p>Microorganisms promised to lead the bio-based revolution for a more sustainable agriculture. Beneficial microorganisms could be a valid alternative to the use of chemical fertilizers or pesticides. However, the increasing use of microbial inoculants is also raising several questions about their efficacy and their effects on the autochthonous soil microorganisms. There are two major issues on the application of bioinoculants to soil: (i) their detection in soil, and the analysis of their persistence and fate; (ii) the monitoring of the impact of the introduced bioinoculant on native soil microbial communities. This review explores the strategies and methods that can be applied to the detection of microbial inoculants and to soil monitoring. The discussion includes a comprehensive critical assessment of the available tools, based on morpho-phenological, molecular, and microscopic analyses. The prospects for future development of protocols for regulatory or commercial purposes are also discussed, underlining the need for a multi-method (polyphasic) approach to ensure the necessary level of discrimination required to track and monitor bioinoculants in soil.</jats:p>","id":"10.3389/fmicb.2021.698491"}

We found that the in-season level of leaf damage by <jats:italic>O. communa</jats:italic> consistently helped to explain seed production in combination with plant volume and site throughout the season. Feeding damage, plant volume and site also explained pollen production by <jats:italic>A. artemisiifolia</jats:italic> six weeks before male flower formation. At three out of four sites, plants with more than 10% leaf damage in mid-June or early July had a very low likelihood of seed formation. Leaf damage proved to be a better explanatory variable than <jats:italic>O. communa</jats:italic> abundance. Our results suggest that the monitoring of the in-season leaf damage can help to project the local impact of <jats:italic>O. communa</jats:italic> on <jats:italic>A. artemisiifolia</jats:italic> at the end of the season and thus inform management regarding the needs for additional measures to control this prominent invader.</jats:p>","id":"10.3897/neobiota.55.46874"}

{"text":"<jats:p>Earth is experiencing a substantial loss of biodiversity at the global scale, while both species gains and losses are occurring at local and regional scales. The influence of these nonrandom changes in species distributions could profoundly affect the functioning of ecosystems and the essential services that they provide. However, few experimental tests have been conducted examining the influence of species invasions on ecosystem functioning. Even fewer have been conducted using invasive ecosystem engineers, which can have disproportionately strong influence on native ecosystems relative to their own biomass. The invasion of exotic earthworms is a prime example of an ecosystem engineer that is influencing many ecosystems around the world. In particular, European earthworm invasions of northern North American forests cause simultaneous species gains and losses with significant consequences for essential ecosystem processes like nutrient cycling and crucial services to humanity like soil erosion control and carbon sequestration. Exotic earthworms are expected to select for specific traits in communities of soil microorganisms (fast-growing bacteria species), soil fauna (promoting the bacterial energy channel), and plants (graminoids) through direct and indirect effects. This will accelerate some ecosystem processes and decelerate others, fundamentally altering how invaded forests function. This project aims to investigate ecosystem responses of northern North American forests to earthworm invasion. Using a novel, synthetic combination of field observations, field experiments, lab experiments, and meta-analyses, the proposed work will be the first systematic examination of earthworm effects on (1) plant communities and (2) soil food webs and processes. Further, (3) effects of a changing climate (warming and reduced summer precipitation) on earthworm performance will be investigated in a unique field experiment designed to predict the future spread and consequences of earthworm invasion in North America. By assessing the soil chemical and physical properties as well as the taxonomic (e.g., by the latest next-generation sequencing techniques) and functional composition of plant, soil microbial and animal communities and the processes they drive in four forests, work packages I-III take complementary approaches to derive a comprehensive and generalizable picture of how ecosystems change in response to earthworm invasion. Finally, in work package IV, meta-analyses will be used to integrate the information from work packages I-III and existing literature to investigate if earthworms cause invasion waves, invasion meltdowns, habitat homogenization, and ecosystem state shifts. Global data will be synthesized to test if the relative magnitude of effects differs from place to place depending on the functional dissimilarity between native soil fauna and exotic earthworms. Moving from local to global scale, the present proposal examines the influence of earthworm invasions on biodiversity\u2013ecosystem functioning relationships from an aboveground\u2013belowground perspective in natural settings. This approach is highly innovative as it utilizes the invasion by exotic earthworms as an exciting model system that links invasion biology with trait-based community ecology, global change research, and ecosystem ecology, pioneering a new generation of biodiversity\u2013ecosystem functioning research.</jats:p>","id":"10.3897/rio.5.e34564"}

{"text":"Open AccessPeer reviewed In the northern hemisphere, boreal forests are a major source of biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), which drive atmospheric processes and lead to cloud formation and changes in the Earth's radiation budget. Although forest vegetation is known to be a significant source of BVOCs, the role of soil and the forest floor, and especially interannual variations in fluxes, remains largely unknown due to a lack of long-term measurements. Our aim was to determine the interannual, seasonal and diurnal dynamics of boreal forest floor volatile organic compound (VOC) fluxes and to estimate how much they contribute to ecosystem VOC fluxes. We present here an 8-year data set of forest floor VOC fluxes, measured with three automated chambers connected to the quadrupole proton transfer reaction mass spectrometer (quadrupole PTR-MS). The exceptionally long data set shows that forest floor fluxes were dominated by monoterpenes and methanol, with relatively comparable emission rates between the years. Weekly mean monoterpene fluxes from the forest floor were highest in spring and in autumn (maximum 59 and 86 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively), whereas the oxygenated VOC fluxes such as methanol had highest weekly mean fluxes in spring and summer (maximum 24 and 79 mu g m(-2) h(-1), respectively). Although the chamber locations differed from each other in emission rates, the inter-annual dynamics were very similar and systematic. Accounting for this chamber location dependent variability, temperature and relative humidity, a mixed effects linear model was able to explain 79-88% of monoterpene, methanol, acetone, and acetaldehyde fluxes from the boreal forest floor. The boreal forest floor was a significant contributor in the forest stand fluxes, but its importance varies between seasons, being most important in autumn. The forest floor emitted 2-93% of monoterpene fluxes in spring and autumn and 1-72% of methanol fluxes in spring and early summer. The forest floor covered only a few percent of the forest stand fluxes in summer.","id":"10.3389/fpls.2019.00191"}

{"text":"Open AccessIn freshwater wetlands, redox interfaces characterized by circumneutral pH, steep gradients in O2, and a continual supply of Fe(II) form ecological niches favorable to microaerophilic iron(II) oxidizing bacteria (FeOB) and the formation of flocs; associations of (a)biotic mineral phases, microorganisms, and (microbially-derived) organic matter. On the volcanic island of Iceland, wetlands are replenished with Fe-rich surface-, ground- and springwater. Combined with extensive drainage of lowland wetlands, which forms artificial redox gradients, accumulations of bright orange (a)biotically-derived Fe-rich flocs are common features of Icelandic wetlands. These loosely consolidated flocs are easily mobilized, and, considering the proximity of Iceland's lowland wetlands to the coast, are likely to contribute to the suspended sediment load transported to coastal waters. To date, however, little is known regarding (Fe) mineral and elemental composition of the flocs. In this study, flocs from wetlands (n = 16) across Iceland were analyzed using X-ray diffraction and spectroscopic techniques (X-ray absorption and 57Fe M\u00f6ssbauer) combined with chemical extractions and (electron) microscopy to comprehensively characterize floc mineral, elemental, and structural composition. All flocs were rich in Fe (229\u2013414 mg/g), and floc Fe minerals comprised primarily ferrihydrite and nano-crystalline lepidocrocite, with a single floc sample containing nano-crystalline goethite. Floc mineralogy also included Fe in clay minerals and appreciable poorly-crystalline aluminosilicates, most likely allophane and/or imogolite. Microscopy images revealed that floc (bio)organics largely comprised mineral encrusted microbially-derived components (i.e. sheaths, stalks, and EPS) indicative of common FeOB Leptothrix spp. and Gallionella spp. Trace element contents in the flocs were in the low \u03bcg/g range, however nearly all trace elements were extracted with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. This finding suggests that the (a)biotic reductive dissolution of floc Fe minerals, plausibly driven by exposure to the varied geochemical conditions of coastal waters following floc mobilization, could lead to the release of associated trace elements. Thus, the flocs should be considered vectors for transport of Fe, organic carbon, and trace elements from Icelandic wetlands to coastal waters.

{"text":"Soil suppressiveness to pathogens is defined as the capacity of soil to regulate soil-borne pathogens. It can be managed by agricultural practices, but the effects reported so far remain inconsistent. Soil suppressiveness is difficult to predict and for this reason different soil properties have been linked to it with the aim to find informative indicators, but these relationships are not conclusive. The objectives of this study were i) to test if soil suppressiveness is affected by long-term agricultural management such as tillage and organic matter (OM) addition; ii) to understand the direct and indirect relationships between soil suppressiveness and labile organic carbon fractions; and iii) to understand the relationship between soil suppressiveness and other chemical, physical and biological soil quality indicators. We measured soil suppressiveness with a bioassay using Pythium ultimum - Lepidium sativum (cress) as a model system. The bioassay was performed in soils from 10 European long-term field experiments (LTEs) which had as main soil management practices tillage and/or organic matter addition. We found that the site had a stronger influence on soil suppressiveness than agricultural practices. Reduced tillage had a positive effect on the suppressive capacity of the soil across sites using an overall model. Organic farming and mineral fertilization increased soil suppressiveness in some LTEs, but no overall effect of OM was found when aggregating the LTEs. Soil suppressiveness across LTEs was linked mainly to microbial biomass and labile carbon in the soil, but not to total soil organic matter content. From structural equation modelling (SEM) we conclude that labile carbon is important for the maintenance of an abundant and active soil microbial community, which is essential for the expression of soil suppressiveness. However, soil suppressiveness could only partly (25%) be explained by the soil parameters measured, suggesting that other mechanisms contribute to soil suppressiveness such as the presence and the activity of specific bacterial and fungal taxa with high biocontrol activity.","id":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.03.012"}

{"text":"Averaged 7-day composite effluent wastewater samples from twelve wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in nine countries (Romania, Serbia, Hungary, Slovenia, Croatia, Slovakia, Czechia, Austria, Germany) in the Danube River Basin were collected. WWTPs' selection was based on countries' dominant technology and a number of served population with the aim to get a representative holistic view of the pollution status. Samples were analyzed for 2248 chemicals of emerging concern (CECs) by wide-scope target screening employing LC-ESI-QTOF-MS. 280 compounds were detected at least in one sample and quantified. Spatial differences in the concentrations and distribution of the compounds classes were discussed. Additionally, samples were analyzed for the possible agonistic/antagonistic potencies using a panel of in vitro transactivation reporter gene CALUX\u00ae bioassays including ER\u03b1 (estrogenics), anti-AR (anti-androgens), GR (glucocorticoids), anti-PR (anti-progestins), PPAR\u03b1 and PPAR\u03b3 (peroxisome proliferators) and PAH assays. The potency of the wastewater samples to cause oxidative stress and induce xenobiotic metabolism was determined using the Nrf2 and PXR CALUX\u00ae bioassays, respectively. The signals from each of the bioassays were compared with the recently developed effect-based trigger values (EBTs) and thus allowed for allocating the wastewater effluents into four categories based on their measured toxicity, proposing a putative action plan for wastewater operators. Moreover, samples were analyzed for antibiotics and 13 antibiotic-resistant genes (ARGs) and one mobile genetic element (intl1) with the aim to assess the potential for antibiotic resistance. All data collected from these various types of analysis were stored in an on-line database and can be viewed via interactive map at https://norman-data.eu/EWW_DANUBE.

{"text":"In the present study, we investigated the impact of treated wastewater (TWW) irrigation on the prevalence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in subsoil pore-water, a so-far under-appreciated matrix. We hypothesized that TWW irrigation increases ARG prevalence in subsoil pore-water. This hypothesis was tested using a multiphase approach, which consisted of sampling percolated subsoil pore-water from lysimeter-wells of a real-scale TWW-irrigated field, operated for commercial farming practices, and controlled, laboratory microcosms irrigated with freshwater or TWW. We monitored the abundance of six selected ARGs (sul1, blaOXA-58, tetM, qnrS, blaCTX-M-32 and blaTEM), the intI1 gene associated with mobile genetic elements and an indicator for anthropogenic pollution and bacterial abundance (16S rRNA gene) by qPCR. The bacterial load of subsoil pore water was independent of both, irrigation intensity in the field study and irrigation water type in the microcosms. Among the tested genes in the field study, sul1 and intI1 exhibited constantly higher relative abundances. Their abundance was further positively correlated with increasing irrigation intensity. Controlled microcosm experiments verified the observed field study results: the relative abundance of several genes, including sul1 and intI1, increased significantly when irrigating with TWW compared to freshwater irrigation. Overall, TWW irrigation promoted the spread of ARGs and intI1 in the subsoil pore-water, while the bacterial load was maintained. The combined results from the real-scale agricultural field and the controlled lab microcosms indicate that the dissemination of ARGs in various subsurface environments needs to be taken into account during TWW irrigation scenarios.","id":"10.1016/j.envint.2020.106190"}
{"text":"Microorganisms are critical in mediating carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) cycling processes in soils. Yet, it has long been debated whether the processes underlying biogeochemical cycles are affected by the composition and diversity of the soil microbial community or not. The composition and diversity of soil microbial communities can be influenced by various environmental factors, which in turn are known to impact biogeochemical processes. The objectives of this study were to test effects of multiple edaphic drivers individually and represented as the multivariate soil environment interacting with microbial community composition and diversity, and concomitantly on multiple soil functions (i.e. soil enzyme activities, soil C and N processes). We employed high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq) to analyze bacterial/archaeal and fungal community composition by targeting the 16S rRNA gene and the ITS1 region of soils collected from three land uses (cropland, grassland and forest) deriving from two bedrock forms (silicate and limestone). Based on this data set we explored single and combined effects of edaphic variables on soil microbial community structure and diversity, as well as on soil enzyme activities and several soil C and N processes. We found that both bacterial/archaeal and fungal communities were shaped by the same edaphic factors, with most single edaphic variables and the combined soil environment representation exerting stronger effects on bacterial/archaeal communities than on fungal communities, as demonstrated by (partial) Mantel tests. We also found similar edaphic controls on the bacterial/archaeal/fungal richness and diversity. Soil C processes were only directly affected by the soil environment but not affected by microbial community composition. In contrast, soil N processes were significantly related to bacterial/archaeal community composition and bacterial/archaeal/fungal richness/diversity but not directly affected by the soil environment. This indicates direct control of the soil environment on soil C processes and indirect control of the soil environment on soil N processes by structuring the microbial communities. The study further highlights the importance of edaphic drivers and microbial communities (i.e. composition and diversity) on important soil C and N processes.","id":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2019.107521"}

{"text":"Open AccessSoil Biology and Biochemistry, 148 ISSN:1879-3428 ISSN:0038-0717 Trophic interactions play a vital role in soil functioning and are increasingly considered as important drivers of the soil microbiome and biogeochemical cycles. In the last decade, novel tools to decipher the structure of soil food webs have provided unprecedent advance in describing complex trophic interactions. Yet, the major challenge remains to understand the drivers of the trophic interactions. Evidence suggests that small scale soil physical structure may offer a unifying framework for understanding the nature and patterns of trophic interactions in soils. Here, we review the current knowledge of how restrictions on soil organisms\u2019 ability to sense and access food resources/prey inherent to soil physical structure essentially shape trophic interactions. We focus primarily on organisms unable to deform the soil and create pores themselves, such as bacteria, fungi, protists, nematodes and microarthropods, and consider pore geometry, connectivity and hydration status as main descriptors of the soil physical structure. We point that the soil physical structure appears to mostly limit the sensing and accessibility to food resources/prey, with negative effects on bottom up controls. The main mechanisms are (i) the reduced transport of sensing molecules, notably volatiles, through the soil matrix and (ii) the wide presence of refuges leading to pore size segregation of consumer/predators and food sources/prey in pores of contrasting size. In addition, variations in the connectivity of the soil pores and the water film is suggested as a central aspect driving encounter probability between consumers/predator and food source/prey and hence locally decrease or increase top-down controls. Constraints imposed by the soil physical structure on trophic interactions are thought to be major drivers of the soil diversity and local community assemblage, notably by favoring a variety of adaptations to feed in this dark labyrinth (food specialists/flexible/generalists) and by limiting competitive exclusion through limited encounter probability of consumers. We conclude with possible future ways for an interdisciplinary and more quantitative research merging soil physics and soil food web ecology.","id":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2020.107876"}

{"text":"Open AccessSoil biocrusts (communities of cyanobacteria, algae, mosses, lichens, and heterotrophs living at the soil surface) are fundamental components of dryland ecosystems worldwide. There is increasing concern over the potential for increasing nitrogen (N) inputs to affect biocrusts. This is of special concern in Mediterranean Basin drylands that face the threat of increased N inputs however, the effect on biocrusts remains poorly studied. We evaluated the potential effects of increased N inputs on biocrust structure and functioning in surrounding Mediterranean shrublands in the seventh year of a N-manipulation field experiment. We tracked the N-driven changes in biotope (changes in bare soil and in the non-legume and the legume occupation areas, and the percentage of radiation intercepted by plant canopies), evaluated biocrust functional traits (based on pigments) and measured biocrust functioning in terms of C and N cycling, soil fertility (macro and micronutrients) and biodiversity, and integrated these multiple soil functions simultaneously (i.e. soil multifunctionality) Biocrust pigment concentration was significantly influenced by both plant legacy and N input. Biocrust pigments revealed a clear functional shift from: i) biocrusts dominated by photosynthetically inactive cyanobacteria that fix N and are mostly committed to photoprotection at the expense of N-containing pigments under low N inputs; into ii) biocrusts more evenly composed of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, which are more photosynthetically active, but less committed to photoprotection and N fixation under exposure to increased N inputs. The N-driven functional and structural changes in biocrusts resulted in trade-offs in biocrust functioning and processes (only N fixation was affected) and an overall improvement in biocrust multifunctionality. By itself, biocrust pigment evenness accounted for ~50% of the observed variation in biocrust multifunctionality. The biocrust pigment functional approach we adopted to study the effects of increased N inputs from patchy developed anthropogenic landscapes provides novel and critical knowledge of biocrusts community and functioning, which may be used as a tool in biodiversity conservation strategies, ecosystem functions and ecological modelling.

{"text":"Abstract   Soil moisture is one of the most important factors controlling the activity and diversity of soil microorganisms. Soils exposed to pronounced cycles of drying and rewetting (D/RW) exhibit disconnected patterns in microbial growth and respiration at RW. These patterns differ depending on the preceding soil moisture history, leading to contrasting amounts of carbon retained in the soil as biomass versus that respired as CO2. The mechanisms underlying these microbially-induced dynamics are still unclear. In this work, we used the process-based soil microbial model EcoSMMARTS to offer candidate explanations for: i) how soil moisture can shape the structure of microbial communities, ii) how soil moisture history affects the responses during D/RW, iii) what microbial mechanisms control the shape, intensity and duration of these responses, and iv) what carbon sources sustain the increased biogeochemical rates after RW. We first evaluated the response to D/RW in bacterial communities previously exposed to two different stress histories (\u2018moderate\u2019 vs \u2018severe\u2019 soil moisture regimes). We found that both the history of soil moisture and the harshness of the dry period preceding the rewetting shaped the structure and physiology of microbial communities. The characteristics of these communities determined the harshness experienced and the nature of the responses to RW obtained. Modelled communities exposed to extended severe conditions showed a resilient response to D/RW, whereas those exposed to moderate environments exhibited a more sensitive response. We then interchanged the soil moisture regimes and found that the progressive adaptation of microbial physiology and structure to new environmental conditions resulted in a switch in the response patterns. These microbial changes also determined the contribution of biomass synthesis, osmoregulation, mineralization by cell residues, and disruption of soil aggregates to CO2 emissions.","id":"10.1016/j.soilbio.2021.108400"}

{"text":"Abstract   Nowadays, photovoltaic (PV) technology has reached a high level of maturity in terms of module efficiency and cost competitiveness in comparison with other energy technologies. As PV has achieved high levels of deployment, the development of devices that can help to reduce PV operation and maintenance costs has become a priority. Soiling can be cause of significant losses in certain PV plants and its detection has become essential to ensure a correct mitigation. For this reason, accurate and low-cost monitoring devices are needed. While soiling stations have been traditionally employed to measure the impact of soiling, their high cost and maintenance have led to the development of innovative low-cost optical sensors, such as the device presented in this work and named \u201cDUSST\u201d (Detector Unit for Soiling Spectral Transmittance). The thermal characterization of DUSST\u2019s components and the methodology used to predict soiling transmittance losses are presented in this study. The results show that the losses can be predicted with an error lower than 1.4%. The method has been verified with an experimental campaign with naturally soiled coupons exposed outdoors in Jaen, Spain.","id":"10.1016/j.solener.2020.10.028"}

{"text":"Abstract   This study assessed the behaviour of a constructive material in CSP plants, namely ferritic-martensitic steel, with molten NaNO3/KNO3 (60/40\u202fwt%), also known as Solar Salt. To this end, EIS is presented as a suitable technique to evaluate and monitor the resistance of this material to Solar Salt at 580\u202f\u00b0C. Tests were performed up to 1000\u202fh and results were also supported by gravimetric and microstructural characterisation of the samples and chemical analysis of the salt. According to the EIS results, a diffusion-controlled reaction occurred during contact, which indicates that the corrosion process follows a porous layer mechanism. The results also indicated variations in corrosion layer thickness and instability of the salt during the whole test. The EIS results were also used for determining the corrosion rate, this being estimated at ~300\u202f\u00b5m\u202fyear\u22121. Results obtained by EIS were in line with the behaviour of P91 steel as measured by gravimetric, morphological and chemical analysis. Thus, the results confirm the suitability of EIS for monitoring corrosion processes in real-time of constructive materials in CSP plants.","id":"10.1016/j.solmat.2018.11.007"}

{"text":"Abstract   Solar reflectors for Concentrating Solar Power (CSP) technologies are required to maintain their optical properties in demanding environments for more than 20 years of service-life. The durability of the commonly used silvered-glass reflectors is typically qualified by means of accelerated aging. Recently, the Spanish standardization committee UNE has published the first specific standard for this topic, which defines a set of accelerated aging tests for CSP reflectors. However, the standard does not contain pass/fail criteria. This paper proposes useful acceptance criteria for the accelerated tests defined by UNE, helping to interpret the obtained degradation results. The criteria have been determined by analyzing the collected accelerated aging data over the past 5 years in the OPAC laboratory, a joint research group of DLR and CIEMAT. Data from six different 4\u202fmm silvered-glass manufacturers is presented, covering nearly the entire market of commercially available silvered-glass mirrors, and going way beyond the recommended testing times of the UNE standard. The data may be used to benchmark initial reflective properties (before aging) and the performance during accelerated durability testing. In addition, recommendations for improvements of the standard are given and an estimate of the acceleration factor of the Copper Accelerate Salt Spray (CASS) test with respect to a highly corrosive outdoor environment is presented.","id":"10.1016/j.solmat.2019.01.008"}

{"text":"Open AccessComment: Accepted Manuscript (Postprint) Soiling impacts the photovoltaic (PV) module performance by reducing the amount of light reaching the photovoltaic cells and by changing their external spectral response. Currently, the soiling monitoring market is moving toward optical sensors that measure transmittance or reflectance, rather than directly measuring the impact of soiling on the performance of photovoltaic modules. These sensors, which use a single optical measurement, are not able to correct the soiling losses that depend on the solar irradiance spectra and on the spectral response of the monitored PV material. This work investigates methods that can improve the optical detection of soiling by extracting the full soiling spectrum profiles using only two or three monochromatic measurements. Spectral transmittance data, measured with a spectrophotometer and collected during a 46-week experimental soiling study carried out in Ja 'en, Spain, was analysed in this work. The use of a spectral profile for the hemispherical transmittance of soiled PV glass is found to significantly improve the soiling detection, returning the lowest errors independently of the PV materials and irradiance conditions. In addition, this work shows that it is also possible to select the measurement wavelengths to minimize the soiling loss detection error depending on the monitored PV semiconductor material (silicon, CdTe, a-Si, CIGS and a representative perovskite). The approaches discussed in this work are also found to be more robust to potential measurement errors compared to single wavelength measurement techniques.","id":"10.1016/j.solmat.2020.110539"}

{"text":"Abstract   Sandy soils are used in agriculture in different regions of the world. In Poland soils derived from sands occupy about 50% of agricultural area. Productivity of the soils depend on the soil properties that vary in the scale of field. This study aimed at determining and mapping the within-field variation of soil physical and chemical properties and grain yield of oats, rye, oats and triticale in 2001, 2002, 2003, 2015, respectively. The experiment was set up in a field (200\u00a0\u00d7\u00a050\u00a0m) on sandy soil in Trzebieszow (region Podlasie, Poland). The soil measurements included sand, silt, clay, and organic carbon (SOC) contents, cation exchange capacity (CEC), pH in the topsoil (0\u201310\u00a0cm) and subsoil (30\u201340\u00a0cm) layers in 2001, and water content and bulk density in the topsoil layer in spring and summer 2002\u20132003. The yields of oats were assessed in 2001 and 2003 and those of rye and triticale in 2002 and 2015, respectively. The soil properties and cereal yields were determined at 33\u201355 points in a grid evenly covering the whole field area. The results were analyzed using classic statistics and geostatistics by constructing semivariograms and 2D mapping by Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW). The cereal grain yields were significantly positively correlated with the topsoil water content (SWC) (r\u00a0=\u00a00.295\u20130.711), clay content (r\u00a0=\u00a00.081\u20130.174), and SOC in the subsoil (r\u00a0=\u00a00.208\u20130.271) and CEC in both layers (r\u00a0=\u00a00.123\u20130.298) and negatively correlated with bulk density (BD) (r\u00a0=\u00a0\u20130.065 to \u22120.279). The spatial dependence determined by the \u201cnugget-to-sill\u201d ratio was moderate or weak for the silt and clay content, CEC, and pH (29\u201379%) and strong for SOC, BD, SWC, and crop yield (0.2\u201313.2%). The effective range of the spatial dependence for all studied quantities varied from 9.9 to 120\u00a0m. The cereal yields were positively and significantly correlated between all study years (r\u00a0=\u00a00.141\u20130.734), which indicates inter-annual similarity in their spatial distribution. The 2D maps based on the IDW allowed assessing how gradual or sharp the changes in the studied quantities from one place to another are. Similar spatial patterns of the SWC, SOC and CEC, and crop yields were observed. This is of importance in precise and sustainable field management aimed at increasing and aligning spatial crop productivity of the studied low-productivity sandy soils that will have to be used in crop production due to the current shortage of land resources and food supplies on a global scale.","id":"10.1016/j.still.2017.07.015"}

{"text":"Abstract   We compared soil physical, chemical and biological properties, erosion rate and carbon allocation to soil physical fractions between conventional tillage (CT) and no-till (NT) management at a clay soil site under spring cereal monoculture in southwestern Finland. Subsurface drain discharge, surface runoff and soil erosion were continuously monitored in 2008 \u2212 2018. At the end of the 10-year monitoring period in 2018, various soil properties and earthworm total density, mass and species richness were determined. Total soil erosion was 56 % less in NT than in CT although surface water discharge was higher in NT. NT had a clear effect on the topsoil physical structure by decreasing the pore size and increasing soil aggregate size. The total soil carbon stock in the 700 kg m\u22122 mineral topsoil layer (approx. 0\u221260 cm layer) was slightly lower in NT (108 \u00b1 12 Mg C ha-1) than in CT (118 \u00b1 9.0 Mg C ha-1) due to lower carbon content of the 10\u221230 cm layer in NT. In NT the proportion of large macroaggregates was higher and more organic carbon was bound to large macroaggregates in the 0\u221210 cm layer which may be related to the higher abundance of earthworms in NT. The results showed that NT is an effective method to reduce erosion rates but other means to increase carbon input especially below the topsoil layer are likely required to achieve a significant increase in the carbon stock of boreal clay soils. For both tillage managements, the rate of erosion through subsurface drains depended clearly on annual precipitation and winter temperature, posing a challenge in the future climate with mild winters and more extreme discharges.","id":"10.1016/j.still.2021.105043"}

This study aimed to calibrate and cross-validate a HS-AD model for homogenized reactors in order to assess the effects of high NH3 levels in HS-AD of OFMSW, but also to evaluate the suitability of the reversible non-competitive inhibition function to reproduce the effect of NH3 on the main acetogenic and methanogenic populations. The practical identifiability of structural/biochemical parameters (i.e. 35) and initial conditions (i.e. 32) was evaluated using batch experiments at different TS and/or inoculum-to-substrate ratios. Variance-based global sensitivity analysis and approximate Bayesian computation were used for parameter optimization. The experimental data in this study permitted to estimate up to 8 biochemical parameters, whereas the rest of parameters and biomass contents were poorly identifiable. The study also showed the relatively high levels of NH3 (i.e. up to 2.3\u202fg\u202fN/L) and ionic strength (i.e. up to 0.9\u202fM) when increasing TS in HS-AD of OFMSW. However, the NH3 non-competitive function was unable to capture the acetogenic/methanogenic inhibition. Therefore, the calibration emphasized the need for target-oriented experimental data to enhance the practical identifiability and the predictive capabilities of structured HS-AD models, but also the need for further testing the NH3 inhibition function used in these simulations.","id":"10.1016/j.watres.2019.114932"}

{"text":"Open AccessOriginal Research info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersion Esca is a disease complex belonging to the grapevine trunk diseases cluster. It comprises five syndromes, three main fungal pathogenic agents and several symptoms, both internal (i.e., affecting woody tissue) and external (e.g., affecting leaves and bunches). The etiology and epidemiology of this disease complex remain, in part, unclear. Some of the points that are still under discussion concern the sudden rise in disease incidence, the simultaneous presence of multiple wood pathogens in affected grapevines, the causal agents and the discontinuity in time of leaf symptoms manifestation. The standard approach to the study of esca has been mostly through culture-dependent studies, yet, leaving many questions unanswered. In this study, we used Illumina R next-generation amplicon sequencing to investigate the mycobiome of grapevines wood in a vineyard with history of esca. We characterized the wood mycobiome composition, investigated the spatial dynamics of the fungal communities in different areas of the stem and in canes, and assessed the putative link between mycobiome and leaf symptoms. An unprecedented diversity of fungi is presented (289 taxa), including five genera reported for the first time in association with grapevines wood (Debaryomyces, Trematosphaeria, Biatriospora, Lopadostoma, and Malassezia) and numerous hitherto unreported species. Esca-associated fungi Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Fomitiporia sp. dominate the fungal community, and numerous other fungi associated with wood syndromes are also encountered (e.g., Eutypa spp., Inonotus hispidus). The spatial analysis revealed differences in diversity, evenness and taxa abundances, the unique presence of certain fungi in specific areas of the plants, and tissue specificity. Lastly, the mycobiome composition of the woody tissue in proximity to leaves manifesting \u2018tiger stripes\u2019 symptoms of esca, as well as in leaf-symptomatic canes, was highly similar to that of plants not exhibiting any leaf symptomatology. This observation supports the current understanding that leaf symptoms are not directly linked with the fungal communities in the wood. This work builds to the understanding of the microbial ecology of the grapevines wood, offering insights and a critical view on the current knowledge of the etiology of esca","id":"10.3389/fpls.2019.00910"}

Reactive nitrogen (Nr) is an important driver of global change, causing alterations in ecosystem biodiversity and functionality. Environmental assessments require monitoring the emission and deposition of both the amount and types of Nr. This is especially important in heterogeneous landscapes, as different land-cover types emit particular forms of Nr to the atmosphere, which can impact ecosystems distinctively. Such assessments require high spatial resolution maps that also integrate temporal variations, and can only be feasibly achieved by using ecological indicators. Our aim was to rank land-cover types according to the amount and form of emitted atmospheric Nr in a complex landscape with multiple sources of N. To do so, we measured and mapped nitrogen concentration and isotopic composition in lichen thalli, which we then related to land-cover data. Results suggested that, at the landscape scale, intensive agriculture and urban areas were the most important sources of Nr to the atmosphere. Additionally, the ocean greatly influences Nr in land, by providing air with low Nr concentration and a unique isotopic composition. These results have important consequences for managing air pollution at the regional level, as they provide critical information for modeling Nr emission and deposition across regional as well as continental scales.","id":"10.1016/j.envpol.2017.06.102"}

Seven treatments were chosen: CK (non-fertilizer); N (synthetic nitrogen); NP (synthetic N and phosphorus); NPK (synthetic N, P and potassium); NPKM1 (synthetic NPK with manure); 1.5NPKM1 (1.5 times of NPKM1); and M2 (manure alone). Overall, the crop yields of wheat and maize under manure (1.36\u20131.58 and 3.85-5.82\u2009Mg ha\u22121) were higher than those under CK (0.34 and 0.25\u2009Mg ha\u22121) and synthetic fertilized treatments (0.27\u20130.97 and 0.48\u20132.65\u2009Mg ha\u22121), as the averaged of 1991\u20132015. Higher SOC stocks were found under the NPKM1, 1.5NPKM1, and M2 treatments with a pronounced increase in SOC over the first 10 years and stable over the last 15 years. By the boosted regression trees, manure, synthetic fertilizer and soil properties (SOC storage, soil pH, and soil nutrients) accounted for 39%, 21%, and 40% of the variation of the relative yield, respectively. Path analysis identified a network of inter-relations of manure, synthetic fertilizer, and soil properties in the relative yields. Compared to synthetic fertilized treatments, manure application strongly and positively affected the relative yield by increasing SOC storage, soil nutrients, and soil pH (path coefficients: 0.90, 0.88, and 0.76). These factors explained 72% of the crop yields' variance. These results suggest that manure application is a viable strategy for regulating crop yields due to its improvement in soil fertility.","id":"10.1016/j.still.2018.12.022"}

{"text":"Open AccessInternational audience A meta-analysis data-driven approach is developed to represent the soil evaporative efficiency (SEE) defined as the ratio of actual to potential soil evaporation. The new model is tested across a bare soil database composed of more than 30 sites around the world, a clay fraction range of 0.02-0.56, a sand fraction range of 0.05-0.92, and about 30,000 acquisition times. SEE is modeled using a soil resistance ($r_{ss}$) formulation based on surface soil moisture ($ theta$) and two resistance parameters $r_{ss,ref}$ and $ theta_{efolding}$. The data-driven approach aims to express both parameters as a function of observable data including meteorological forcing, cut-off soil moisture value $ theta_{1/2}$ at which SEE=0.5, and first derivative of SEE at $ theta_{1/2}$, named $ Delta theta_{1/2}^{-1}$. An analytical relationship between $(r_{ss,ref}; theta_{efolding})$ and $( theta_{1/2}; Delta theta_{1/2}^{-1})$ is first built by running a soil energy balance model for two extreme conditions with $r_{ss} = 0$ and $r_{ss} sim infty$ using meteorological forcing solely, and by approaching the middle point from the two (wet and dry) reference points. Two different methods are then investigated to estimate the pair $( theta_{1/2} ;  Delta theta_{1/2}^{-1})$ either from the time series of SEE and $ theta$ observations for a given site, or using the soil texture information for all sites. The first method is based on an algorithm specifically designed to accomodate for strongly nonlinear $ text{SEE}( theta)$ relationships and potentially large random deviations of observed SEE from the mean observed $ text{SEE}( theta)$. The second method parameterizes $ theta_{1/2}$ as a multi-linear regression of clay and sand percentages, and sets $ Delta theta_{1/2}^{-1}$ to a constant mean value for all sites. The new model significantly outperformed the evaporation modules of ISBA (Interaction Sol-Biosph `{e}re-Atmosph `{e}re), H-TESSEL (Hydrology-Tiled ECMWF Scheme for Surface Exchange over Land), and CLM (Community Land Model). It has potential for integration in various land-surface schemes, and real calibration capabilities using combined thermal and microwave remote sensing data.","id":"10.1002/2015wr018233"}
