        "text": "Simultaneous determination of multiclass antibiotics and their metabolites in four types of field-grown vegetables || Open AccessPeer reviewed The developed method was evaluated for the determination of 10 antibiotics belonging to four chemical classes (fluoroquinolones, sulfonamides, lincosamides, and metoxybenzylpyrimidines) and six of their metabolites in four vegetable matrices (lettuce, tomato, cauliflower, and broad beans). The reported method detection limits were sufficiently low (0.1\u20135.8 ng/g dry weight) to detect target compounds in vegetables under real agricultural practices. Absolute and relative recovery values ranged from 40 to 118% and from 70 to 118%, respectively, for all targeted compounds at the spike level of 100 ng/g dry weight. Regarding method precision, the highest relative standard deviation (RSD) was obtained for enrofloxacin in lettuce (20%), while for the rest of the compounds in all matrices, the RSD values were below 20% for the same spike level. Matrix effects, due to electrospray ionization, ranged from \u2212 26 to 29% for 85% of all estimated values. In a field study, four of the 10 targeted antibiotics were detected in tested vegetables. For the first time, antibiotic metabolites were quantified in vegetables grown under real field conditions. More specifically, decarboxyl ofloxacin and TMP304 were detected in tomato fruits (1.5 ng/g dry weight) and lettuce leaves (21.0\u201323.1 ng/g dry weight), respectively. It is important to remark that the concentration of TMP304 was five times higher than that from the parental compound, emphasizing the importance of metabolite analysis in monitoring studies. Therefore, the method provided a robust, reliable, and simple-to-use tool that could prove useful for routine multiclass analysis of antibiotics and their metabolites in vegetable samples.

This data collection consists of 25 individual tables which are related to each other. General description: In 1980 a fertilization trial started at the Institute for Biodynamic Research in Darmstadt (today Forschungsring e.V.), Germany.  The experiment was set up as a strip design with four replicates, the treatments being farmyard manure treatments with and without biodynamic preparations and mineral fertilization, each at various levels. The objective of the project was to study the product quality of vegetables. After this four year project, interesting differences began to emerge with respect to the soil parameters of organic and mineral treatments. Thus the trial was continued. After some years of a transitional period without particular investigations, a detailed soil biological project was carried out in 1989-1991, focusing on the effects of fertilization upon C- and N-dynamics, enzyme activities and microbial biomass in the soil. A third experimental period (from 1992 to 2009) has focused on the yield formation of cultivated crops and the long-term effects of fertilization treatments upon soil and crop development. Further details are given by Raupp and Oltmanns (2006) and Heitkamp et al.

        "text": "Effects of rainwater harvesting system on soil moisture in rain-fed orchards on the Chinese Loess Plateau || Abstract   Rainwater is a primary water source for the hilly and gully region of the Loess Plateau where an improved efficiency of rainwater utilization is crucial for sustainable agricultural development. A new system, comprised of rainwater harvesting, concentrating infiltration with multi-holed pipe and mulching (RIM), was designed to sustain soil moisture at a proper level in rain-fed orchards in the hilly and gully loess region of China. This study monitored changes in soil moisture and distribution over soil profiles using four treatments: (a) RIM1 with two rainwater harvesting areas, two infiltration pipes and film mulching, (b) RIM2 with one rainwater harvesting area, one infiltration pipe and film mulching, (c) film mulching (FM) only and (d) traditional apple orchard as a control treatment (CK) as a baseline in this experiment. The results showed that mean soil moisture content (SMC) in a range of soil layer between 0 cm and 300 cm for RIM1 and RIM2 treatments increased by 43.01% and 34.78% in 2018 and 30.55% and 26.41% in 2019, respectively. Dividing the soil vertical profile into three layers, i.e., an easy-changing layer (0\u221260 cm), an increasing or decreasing layer (60\u2212180 cm), and a relatively steady layer (180\u2212300 cm), this study examined the vertical changes of soil moisture. The RIM1 and RIM2 treatments induced a large increase in the size and depth of wetted areas over the whole soil layers. The soil moisture was replenished to a horizontal distance of 1.5 m and 2.5 m apart from the trunk within the soil layer between 60 cm and 300 cm under the RIM1 treatment while only the horizontal distance of 1.5 m apart from the trunk under the RIM2 treatment. While the seasonal variation of SMC in the easy-changing soil layer (0\u221260 cm) corresponded to precipitation consistently, the SMC in the deep soil layers (60\u2212300 cm) was not sensitive to precipitation. As a result, the treatments of RIM1, RIM2 and FM improved apple yield and crop water productivity compared with those under the control treatment. In particular, the RIM1 treatment performed the best among the treatments investigated in this study. The results highlighted the efficiency of the RIM system in enhancing the soil moisture, which may be useful to improve an orchard production for rain-fed orchards in the loess hilly and gully region of China."
