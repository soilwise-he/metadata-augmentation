        "text": "Determining the effect of exogenous organic materials on spatial distribution of maize yield || <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Knowledge on spatial distribution of crop yield in relation to fixed soil fertilisation with exogenous organic materials is essential for improving precise crop and soil management practices within a field. This study assessed the effect of various application rates and types of exogenous (recycled) organic materials (EOMs) containing different organic matter and nitrogen contents vs. mineral nitrogen on the yield of maize by means of linear regressions (trends), spatial kriging-interpolated maps, and Bland-Altman statistics. The experiments were conducted in 2013 and 2014 on two soils, i.e. loam silt in Braszowice (Poland) and clay silt loam in Pust\u00e9 Jakartice (Czech Republic) under a cross-border cooperation project. The organic materials included compost from manure, slurry, and straw (Ag), industrial organic compost from sewage sludge (Ra), animal meal from animal by-products (Mb), and digestate from a biogas fries factory (Dg). The following 3 application rates of each EOM were adjusted according to the reference 100%\u2009=\u2009200\u2009kg\u2009N ha<jats:sup>\u22121</jats:sup>: 50 (50% N from EOM and 50% mineral N), 75 (75% N from EOM and 25% mineral N), and 100 (100% N from EOM). 100% mineral N was applied on control plots. All treatments were carried out in 4 replicates. The linear regressions between the EOM application rates and the maize yield were in general ascending in the Braszowice soil and descending in the more productive Pust\u00e9 Jakartice soil. The spatial kriging-interpolated maps allowed separating zones of lower and higher yields with EOMs compared to the control. They were attributed in part to the different EOM application rates and soil water contents. The Bland-Altaman statistics showed that addition of 50% of N from EOMs in 2013 caused a decrease and an increase in the maize grain yield in Braszowice and Pust\u00e9 Jakartice, respectively, whereas the inverse was true with the 75 and 100% EOM additions. In 2014, the yield of maize for silage increased with the increasing EOM application rate in Braszowice and decreased in Pust\u00e9 Jakartice, but it was smaller on all EOM-amended plots than in the control. As shown by the limits of agreement lines, the maize yields were more even in Pust\u00e9 Jakartice than Braszowice. These results provide helpful information for selection of the most yield-producing EOM rates depending on the site soil conditions and prevalent weather conditions.</jats:p>"

        "text": "Urban Living Labs, Circular Economy and Nature-Based Solutions: Ideation and Testing of a New Soil in the City of Turin Using a Multi-stakeholder Perspective || <jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>In the attempt to foster circular economy (CE), cities are increasingly adopting urban living labs (ULLs) as sites of co-production aimed at testing alternative solutions based on the reuse of products, reduction of consumption and recycling of materials. Taking this perspective, our study adopts an exploratory research design to discover the pragmatic implications emerging from a case study. The City of Turin joined proGIreg, a European project that entails the regeneration of former industrial districts by means of nature-based solutions (NBS). Ranging from aquaponics to green roofs, seven NBS have been experimented in Turin, which rely on the use of natural systems to tackle social, economic and environmental challenges efficiently and sustainably. Among them, the most promising is related to the production and test of the \u2018<jats:italic>new soil</jats:italic>\u2019, a blend obtained by mixing earth materials coming from construction sites with compost, zeolites and mycorrhizae. The case herein presented is interesting to analyse for the multi-stakeholder management setting used, where public institutions, private companies, research institutions, citizens and associations collaborated in the co-creation and testing phase of the NBS. Consequently, the data collected through participant observation and direct interviews allow researchers to describe multi-stakeholders\u2019 dynamics and how they work. Thus, this paper narrates a micro-contextual experience while providing a critique. Results include an analysis of the unique combination of different stakeholders, which strongly impacted on the management and the effectiveness of the entire project. By consequence, the paper offers both theoretical contributions to the relational branch of stakeholder theory and practical evidence in demonstrating the importance of the relational branch of the theory over a more traditional transactional view.</jats:p>"
