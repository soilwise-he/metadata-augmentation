        "text": "Regional climate change observational data FOR 1695 (Part 6.3 of data collection, table LAI) || We present a comprehensive, high-quality dataset characterising soil-vegetation and land-surface processes from continuous measurements conducted in two climatically contrasting study regions in South West Germany: the warmer and drier Kraichgau region with a mean temperature of 9.7\u00b0C and annual precipitation of 890 mm, and the cooler and wetter Swabian. Alp with mean temperature 7.5\u00b0C and annual precipitation 1042 mm. In each region, measurements were conducted over a time period of nine cropping seasons from 2009 to 2018. The backbone of the investigation was formed by six eddy-covariance stations (EC) which measured fluxes of water, energy and carbon dioxide between the land surface and the atmosphere at half hourly resolution. This resulted in a dataset containing measurements from a total of 54 site*years containing observations with a multitude of crops, as well as considerable variation in local growing season climates. The presented multi-site, multi-year data set is composed of crop-related data on phenological development stages, canopy height, leaf area index, vegetative and generative biomass and their respective carbon and nitrogen content. Time series of soil temperature and soil water content were monitored with 30-min resolution at various points in the soil profile, including ground heat fluxes. Moreover, more than 1,200 soil samples were taken to study changes of carbon and nitrogen contents. One station in each region has now been set up as continuous observatories of state variables and fluxes in intensively managed agricultural fields.\nResearch domain: Soil Sciences\nThe corresponding publication can be accessed here:\u00a0https://doi.org/10.5194/essd-2020-396\u00a0\nDataset version 1.1 \n This table contains data on leaf area index.\n\nRelated datasets are listed in the metadata element 'Related Identifier'."
